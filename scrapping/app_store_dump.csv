Can you sort the coloured shapes correctly? Can you remember the shape and colour combinations? And can you do it against the clock?

Score as highly as possible by sorting the different coloured shapes you are instructed to 'keep' or 'discard'.

Memorise the shape and colour combinations - red circles, blue squares, or maybe, any coloured crescent or any green shape - and whether you must 'keep' or 'discard' them. But be quick - you only have five seconds to commit them to memory!

Swipe the shapes left, right or down with your finger - doing so correctly scores you points.

Do it right inside the target area to score more and increase the target area's size. This allows you to score more points more easily.

Mistakes are punished by reducing the target area - if it disappears the game is over.

Grow the target area to fill the screen to beat the level and get bonuses or survive until the time runs out and progress by the skin of your teeth!

Check your progress against others on the leader boards.","Games,Casual",Shape Shifter - Recall Game,Free

Top, bake, and serve pizzas in this award-winning game that’s reimagined for iPhone and iPod Touch.

You'll need to multitask between each area of the pizzeria, with new controls designed to work just right in the palm of your hand.  Head to the Order Station to watch for customers waiting in the lobby.  Switch to the Topping Station to add a variety of toppings to each pizza.  Move to the Bake Station to cook the pizzas in the oven until they're baked just right.  Jump to the Cutting Station to cut the pizza into perfect slices.  Each station is a hands-on experience, where you'll need to drag, swipe, and tap your way through the pizza-building process.

Keep your customers happy to earn more points and level up.  As your level rises, you'll unlock new toppings in the shop, and new customers will start visiting the Pizzeria!  A well-crafted pizza also earns you tips, which you can spend on upgrades and decorations for the lobby!

** NEW FOR PAPA'S PIZZERIA TO GO **

Papa's Pizzeria To Go is redesigned and reimagined for smaller screens, so your fingers don't get in the way of the action!

CONTROL WITH YOUR THUMBS - You'll switch stations using buttons in the corners of the screen, perfect for your thumbs.  You can also use buttons in the top corners to quickly switch Order Tickets, and you can view all of your Order Tickets in a zoomed-in mode for easy reading.

TOPPING STATION - We've completely redesigned the Topping Station for smaller screens.  Bins of toppings can be scrolled with your thumb, which allows us to have many more toppings than in the original game.  Tap on a bin to select that topping, then tap multiple times on the pizza to add items directly onto the pizza.  You don't need to drag individual toppings onto the pizza, so you can top faster than ever!  A quick swipe on the pizza will send it off the to the Bake Station.

BAKE STATION - Papa Louie's coal-fired oven gets an upgrade!  You can buy new Oven Alarms in the Shop to help you keep track of pizzas in the oven.  Simply drag an alarm onto one of the oven timers, and you'll hear an alert when that pizza is cooked just right.  Buy new Oven Boosters to cook your pizzas even faster than before!

CUTTING STATION - When it's time to cut pizzas, simply touch and drag a line across the pizza to decide where to cut.  If you want even more control to fine-tune your slices, you can also cut using multi-touch!  Use two fingers or thumbs to move each end of the line at the same time, and release to slice your pizza.  If you're having trouble cutting pizzas at the right angle, buy a variety of Cutting Guides in the Shop to cut that perfect slice!

NEW INGREDIENTS - We've added a ton of new ingredients which can't be found in the original Papa's Pizzeria.  As you play the game, you'll unlock 26 unique ingredients to serve your customers!

CUSTOMIZE YOUR LOBBY - You can spend your hard-earned tips in the Shop, where you can find a variety of posters, furniture, and wallpaper styles for your lobby!  Use the brand-new Lobby tool to add items to your restaurant, and move and arrange them however you like!  Choose from over 140 customization items, and every item you add to the lobby will improve your Waiting Score for your customers!

UPDATED FEATURES - Serve picky closers at the end of the day, earn paychecks as you play, and try to please the finicky Food Critic to earn a Blue Ribbon!

How many times have you tried to capture artful images with your iPhone camera but were left wishing you had more features to work with? Slow Shutter Cam puts an end to mere snapshots and gives you some of the most powerful features of a DSLR camera. All this, in a package that fits in your pocket.
 
Slow Shutter Cam offers three capture modes to capture unique images:
 
MOTION BLUR: Equivalent to the shutter priority mode on a DSLR, the Motion Blur mode is perfect for creating ghost images, waterfall effects or suggesting movement in your photographs by adding a blur.

LIGHT TRAIL: The Light Trail mode allows you to 'paint' with light, show car light trails and fireworks or capture any other moving light in a unique way. Unlike shooting with a DSLR and being tied to specific rigid settings to obtain good results, the Light Trail mode takes care of the essentials, letting your creativity soar!

LOW LIGHT: In low light conditions, this capture mode allows the camera to accumulate every photon of light hitting the sensor. The longer the shutter speed, the more light it will accumulate. You can even fine-tune the result using the exposure compensation slider to achieve the exact effect you want!

Highlights:

•  Unlimited Shutter Speed and manual ISO
•  Option to resume capture 
•  Real time live preview - See the result in real time
•  Innovative 'Freeze'  and ‘Blur Strength’ controls
•  Tap to adjust focus/exposure
•  Time-lapse Intervalometer

Can you overcome the never-ending threat of roaming Walkers as you scavenge for supplies across the ravaged Southern landscape?

Da Vinci Eye is the essential digital tool for non-digital artists. Don’t just take our word for it - we’re one of the top five Graphics & Design apps in over 100 countries.

Da Vinci Eye is used by thousands of creatives from painters to bakers to make incredible artwork. The app is not just for tracing, it offers a wide range of drawing tools, lessons, daily drawing prompts, and a supportive community to share your artwork!

IMPORTANT!: Please read how this app works below and the device requirements for AR Mode BEFORE purchasing.

HIGHLIGHTS

• Create incredible artwork from your own photos
• Make hyper-realistic drawings with our strobe feature
• Record time-lapse videos of your drawings
• Separate images into layers by color value, then view those areas on your canvas
• Easily learn the fundamentals of drawing
• Breakdown any image into step-by-step instructions
• Video tutorials
• Use filters to make drawing even easier
• Zoom in to capture micro details in your drawings
• Connect with our community to share your artwork
• Insanely fast customer support!

PERFECT FOR ANY ARTIST

• Bakers
• Cartoonists

• Illustrators
• Fiverr Designers
• Hobbyists
• Makeup artists
• Nail Technicians
• Animators

No matter what skill level you’re at — Da Vinci Eye is here for you!

OVERVIEW

How many times have you been drawing a portrait for hours only to realize that the nose or the eye is in the wrong place? You can use Da Vinci Eye to layout artwork before you begin or even check your work as you progress.

Having a hard time seeing where lights or darks go? Breakdown images into layers by color value. Then virtually project those layers on top of your image. You can see exactly where to place the darkest darks, mid-tones, and highlights.

CAN'T THINK OF WHAT TO DRAW?

Check out our inspiration section for user uploaded reference photos. If you have a great pic, you can even upload your own content for other artists to draw.

LEARNING HOW TO DRAW?

We have lessons using our unique patent-pending learning method. You can also turn ANY photo into a step by step shading drawing lesson.

HOW DOES IT WORK?

Based on a tool that has been used by artists for centuries, this app is a digital version of a Camera Lucida.

You suspend your iPhone or iPad above or in front of your canvas with a stand, tall glass, or other objects easily found around your house. 

When you look through your phone, you will see both the image and the canvas simultaneously. It's similar in functionality to an art projector or light box, but with the ability to do so much more.

You can draw on any surface, zoom in to draw micro details in your drawing, and you don't have to draw in the dark.

WILL THIS HELP ME LEARN HOW TO DRAW?

Using Da Vinci Eye, you will be training your eye to recognize proportions and draw with shading while training your hand to translate precise lines and strokes on paper. You’ll learn faster and more efficiently using our proven techniques compared to any other app.

AR MODE REQUIREMENTS

To use AR mode, you must have an A10x or A11 processor and above. We recommend using:

– iPhone 8 and newer (iPhone 7 and below will not work)
– iPad Mini 5th Generation and newer
– iPad Air 2019 and newer
– iPad Pro 3rd Gen (Any pro made after 2018) and newer

AR & CLASSIC MODE

AR mode anchors your image to an object in the real world. This lets you move your canvas or phone, and the drawing and projected image will stay aligned.

Classic mode is like a normal art projector, where if you move your phone or canvas, the drawing will no longer be aligned.

AR mode is especially useful for drawing or painting on an easel. However, in most cases, Classic mode will achieve the same result.

Take command on both sides of the Battle for Normandy, mastering fast-moving combat and advanced squad-based tactics on the explosive battlefields of northern France.

In Operation Overlord, lead the US Army's Able Company during the D-Day landings, and spearhead the charge from the beaches of Normandy.

From the classic Company of Heroes campaign to the Opposing Fronts and Tales of Valor expansions, this is the complete package without compromise.

FROM D-DAY TO THE FALAISE POCKET
Command both Allies and Axis forces in 38 challenging missions based on pivotal moments that shaped the course of World War II.

STRATEGY WITHOUT LIMITS

TAILORED FOR TOUCHSCREEN
Tailored to and optimised for iPhone and iPad, the Company of Heroes Collection puts an intuitive interface front and centre, for total touch control in the heat of battle.

GAME FEATURES

DRESSED TO IMPRESS

A WIDE WORLD OF MINIONS
You’ll run through crazy locations, from the Anti-Villain League HQ to Vector’s lair, or the ancient past. Each location has its own unique set of obstacles to overcome, so keep your eye(s) peeled! And once you’re ready, you can enter the Top Bananas Room to compete against players from all over your region—or even the world—in an endless running mode to unlock tons of prizes!

OFFLINE ADVENTURES
All this fun can be played offline without Wi-Fi, so you can enjoy the main features of the game anytime, anywhere.

Solve mechanical puzzles, discover hidden objects, escape from rooms and dive into the authentic atmosphere of the Renaissance. Use all your wits to find out what's behind your master's disappearance.

• KEY FEATURES •

SOLVE MECHANICAL PUZZLES
Brain twisters and baffling riddles are all based on Leonardo’s inventions.

ENJOY INTUITIVE TOUCH CONTROL
Navigate Leonardo’s workshop intuitively. Playing the game couldn’t be more fun.

EXPERIENCE THE RENAISSANCE
War machines, complex lockboxes, mechanical puzzles, room escapes will all test your skills.

MASTER UNIQUE MECHANICS
Detect hidden objects by seeing through the surfaces around you.

PEEK INTO THE PAST
An unusual gauntlet allows you to witness events that happened earlier, and learn more of the story.

• WHAT’S THE STORY BEHIND THE HOUSE OF DA VINCI? •
You are Da Vinci’s most promising apprentice. Your master, Leonardo, has disappeared. You have no idea where he’s gone or what has happened. So you begin your quest, your search for the truth. However, Leonardo's workshop is full of puzzles, inventions, escape mechanisms and objects hidden in all corners of beautifully decorated rooms. You’ll need to use all of your brain cells to find out what’s really going on!

We’ve applied our own imagination to the story of the world’s greatest inventor, Leonardo da Vinci, providing players with unique special abilities throughout gameplay. We allow you to warp back into your early days as a young apprentice, exploring the 16th century world around you, peeking into Leonardo’s mechanisms, puzzles and devices, as you eventually become powerful enough to control time itself and learn the secrets hidden in the past.

Many challenging puzzles are inspired by Leonardo Da Vinci's real inventions and ideas. Mysterious locations were created based on original artworks and the wonderful Florence, Italy of 1506.

You and your sibling arrived here from another world. Separated by an unknown god, stripped of your powers, and cast into a deep slumber, you now awake to a world very different from when you first arrived.

Thus begins your journey across Teyvat to seek answers from The Seven — the gods of each element. Along the way, prepare to explore every inch of this wondrous world, join forces with a diverse range of characters, and unravel the countless mysteries that Teyvat holds...

MASSIVE OPEN WORLD

Climb any mountain, swim across any river, and glide over the world below, taking in the jaw-dropping scenery each step of the way. And if you stop to investigate a wandering Seelie or strange mechanism, who knows what you might discover?

ELEMENTAL COMBAT SYSTEM

Harness the seven elements to unleash elemental reactions. Anemo, Electro, Hydro, Pyro, Cryo, Dendro, and Geo interact in all sorts of ways, and Vision wielders have the power to turn this to their advantage.

Will you vaporize Hydro with Pyro, electro-charge it with Electro, or freeze it with Cryo? Your mastery of the elements will give you the upper hand in battle and exploration.

BEAUTIFUL VISUALS

Feast your eyes on the world around you, with a stunning art style, real-time rendering, and finely tuned character animations delivering you a truly immersive visual experience. Lighting and weather all change naturally over time, bringing every detail of this world to life.

SOOTHING SOUNDTRACK

Let the beautiful sounds of Teyvat draw you in as you explore the expansive world around you. Performed by the world's top orchestras such as London Philharmonic Orchestra and Shanghai Symphony Orchestra, the soundtrack changes seamlessly with the time and gameplay to match the mood.

BUILD YOUR DREAM TEAM

Team up with a diverse cast of characters in Teyvat, each with their own unique personalities, stories, and abilities. Discover your favorite party combinations and level up your characters to help you conquer even the most daunting of enemies and domains.

JOURNEY WITH FRIENDS

Team up with friends across various platforms to trigger more elemental action, tackle tricky boss fights, and conquer challenging domains together to reap rich rewards.

As you stand atop the peaks of Jueyun Karst and take in the rolling clouds and vast terrain stretching out before you, you may wish to stay in Teyvat a little longer... But until you are reunited with your lost sibling, how can you rest? Go forth, Traveler, and begin your adventure!

Welcome back to the new and improved Freddy Fazbear's Pizza!

In Five Nights at Freddy's 2, the old and aging animatronics are joined by a new cast of characters. They are kid-friendly, updated with the latest in facial recognition technology, tied into local criminal databases, and promise to put on a safe and entertaining show for kids and grown-ups alike!

What could go wrong?

As the new security guard working nights, your job is to monitor cameras and make sure nothing goes wrong after-hours. The previous guard has complained about the characters trying to get into the office (he has since been moved to day-shift). So to make your job easier, you've been provided with your very own empty Freddy Fazbear head, which should fool the animatronic characters into leaving you alone if they should accidentally enter your office.

As always, Fazbear Entertainment is not responsible for death or dismemberment.

NOTE: Interface and audio in English. Subtitles in English, French, German, Dutch, Spanish (Latin America), Italian, Portuguese (Brazil), Russian, Japanese, Chinese (Simplified), Korean.

Everything on your schedule is neatly laid out in the Today and Upcoming lists, which show your to-dos and calendar events. Each morning, see what you planned for Today and decide what you want to do. The rest is down to you :)

Create your own stacks or learn a pre-programmed one (such as mnemonica), learn our original method for memorization and game your way to stack mastery with our addicting practice settings. 

We’ve been teaching the memorized deck for YEARS and this app is the ultimate evolution of our knowledge, making your journey as seamless and enjoyable as possible. 

‘Learn the Method’

Under this tab you’ll find video and text training all about our method for learning the stack. 

This knowledge is so sought after - 100’s of customers have paid $97 for it in the past. 

‘Customize Your Stack’

So many people begin their journey to learning stack by asking a completely useless question: 

“Which stack?” 

We say: you can learn them all. 

Under this tab you’ll be able to pick a stack to practice, as well as add your own CUSTOM stacks. 

Essentially you can learn an infinite number of stacks with this app, or stick with those we’ve pre-programmed. 

(pre-programmed ft. Mnemonica, Aronoson, Sti-stebbins) 

‘Practice P.A.O’ 

Our method for learning the stack uses the unique P.A.O Method (person, action, object.) 

You will be able to enter your own custom values and practice them within the app! 

In order to protect the integrity of our methods we won’t go any deeper into that here, but you will be able to practice P.A.O within the app. 

‘Practice the Stack’

This is where you’ll spend most of your time.

In the ‘practice the stack’ part of the app there are a lot of settings you can play around with! 

You can practice any part of the stack e.g. 1-10, 5-25, or 1-52 (anything you choose!) 

You can also practice based on suits, odd cards, even cards, red or black cards and more! 

You can also set your own rules for the training deciding whether you want to be timed, lose lives, or practice in free play mode. 

Your custom stacks also automatically sync with this part of the app. 

Each day you practice you’ll update your streak - get to thirty days and we’ll send you something special! 

This app is constantly being worked on to make it the best app in the magic industry regarding stack training - you won’t be disappointed.

Thanks to the travel planner of 9292, you can plan all your trips with the train, bus, metro, tram, and ferry. Need to travel by bicycle, electric bicycle / scooter or a rental bike? We can include that in your travel advice. Enter your trip from A to B and we will immediately show you up-to-date travel information for all public transport in the Netherlands. And the app is prepared for showing Flex-OV such as the watertaxi in Rotterdam. In case of any changes, we will show you an alternative travel advice automatically. The up-to-date public transport planner provides live public transport info for NS, Arriva, Connexxion, Breng, Hermes, Keolis, RRReis, Qbuzz, EBS, U-OV, RET, HTM, GVB and Waterbus.

E-ticket for the entire journey
You can buy e-tickets straight from the travel advice in the 9292 app. The affiliated public transport services for bus, tram, metro and ferry are Breng, Connexxion, EBS, Hermes, HTM, Keolis, RET, U-OV and Waterbus. For all national trains, these are NS, Blauwnet, Qbuzz, Connexxion, Arriva and Keolis.

Music on the go
Plan your journey in the 9292 app. At the bottom of the travel advice of your choice you will see the button ""Playlist for this trip"". This will take you to the Playlist Generator. On this page we create a playlist based on the travel time of your chosen travel advice. Log in to your Spotify account and we place the created playlist in the library of your Spotify account, so that you can easily find it and enjoy your music during your trip.

Occupancy expectation
During these times, it is important to take into account how crowded the train, bus, tram or metro service is for your travel plans. The 9292 app displays the expected occupancy per mode of transport for each travel advice, as communicated to us by the transport services.

Bicycle pre- and post-journey
Under ‘Options’, you can indicate if you want to walk, cycle or ride a scooter at the start or end of  your trip. This will give you the most complete advice with all relevant information for travelling from A to B. You can also opt for an electric bicycle or rental bicycle. To make it even easier, we also show you bicycle rental locations if you select bicycle. Very useful for covering the last bit to your final destination!

From/to
The app has multiple options for selecting your location of departure or arrival: your ‘current location’ (via GPS), a known location (shopping mall, station or attraction), an address or bus stop, your contacts, and even your frequently or recently used locations.

Unique starting screen
Enter your favourite locations and routes on the starting screen by using the plus-sign. This turns the 9292-app into your own personal app for quickly planning your trip from A to B, without needing an account. You can also add a bus stop or station you frequently use to your starting screen this way. Now you will always have access to the up-to-date departure times of that stop.

Save travel advice
Want to save a specific travel advice? You can! Simply use the plus-sign in the top right corner of the travel advice. You can find your saved travel advice by using the menu in the app.

Route on the map
The travel advice shows you a map with the route of that advice. Press on this and you will see the travel advice step by step on a detailed map. Now you can swipe through your entire trip!","Travel,Navigation",9292 public transport planner,Free

Imagine a doll house where the pieces are impossible to lose and never break. A doll house  where new accessories and rooms are given to you for free. 

Imagine if it was designed so that even a 2 year old could use it, yet detailed enough to entertain an 8 year old. 

Imagine a doll house that could excite and captivate your children for hours for less than the price of a cup of coffee.... 

-----------------------------------------------

My PlayHome is the original and best dolls house app. Massively interactive, your kids can explore and use everything in the house. The characters eat, sleep, shower, brush their teeth and more. Want the room to be darker? Close the drapes! Fancy a change in music? Pop a different CD into the stereo!

No other doll house app comes close in interactivity, detail, ease of use and just plain fun!

GSiRotary for iPad is the portable version of the very same Rotary Speaker algorithm found in the software GSi VB3-II and in the hardware keyboards Crumar Mojo (Classic and Suitcase), Mojo Desktop, Mojo 61 as well as in the GSi Gemini.



As a Rotary Speaker effect it reproduces the effect and the tonal characteristics of the famous Leslie speakers, specifically the tube models 122, 147, 142, 145 and 251. It's not based on one single model, because there's actually very little difference between these models. Changing some parameters can make it sound more like a model or more like another one, letting alone the fact that even two or more apparently identical Leslies of the same model would not sound really identical after more than 60 years. GSiRotary takes this into account and offers a parameter set that can help us reach the rotary speaker sound we have in mind.

Main features:
- very low impact on CPU and RAM
- adjustable speeds for upper and lower speakers separately
- adjustable ramp up and down times
- adjustable balance between upper and lower
- adjustable microphone position (angle and distance)
- built-in tube overdrive and digital reverb
- comes as AUv3 plugin","Music,Productivity",GSiRotary,$16.99

*** Top 5 popular apps in education*** 
*** 5 stars nomination Kids Apps Awards apps.weebly.com*** 

Using this educational app kids can practice the math tables from 1 to 20 within a challenging game! You can choose which tables you want to practice and how many tables at the same time. As new sums fall down you quickly have to find the right answer mounted to the vault door to finally open the vault when completing all tables! 

During the development of TableVault several kids and teachers of an elementary school were involved. The kids told us which parts of the game they liked and teachers instructed us in standard school teachings. For example, the time in which a sum is supposed to be solved is defined and integrated into this app. The faster kids solve the sum the more points they get! This method ensures they will automatically try to improve their skills to get the highest score! 

In this app an overview of all practices are saved for each child. This includes all the tables a child has practiced and how well he/she is performing for each table. Thus parents can easily track improvements of all their kids.","Education,Family,Games,Puzzle",Tables Vault - enjoy learning!,$1.99

In the modern app business, it's not easy to stay relevant that long. We're proud to say that after 13 years and counting, we've been delivering wonderful updates with extraordinary new features. And we're going to keep doing that!

GoodReader is a perfect combination of document-reading and file-managing capabilities. It's your one-stop shop for all your document needs on your iOS device.

Use the app once, and you'll be hooked. Soon you'll be wondering how you ever managed to work without it.

-= File Reading =-
PDF, TXT, MS Office, iWork, HTML, pictures, music & audio-books, videos. This is what you can view in GoodReader, plus you can also annotate PDF files and edit TXT files.

-= PDF Reading and Annotating =-
PDF files is where GoodReader truly shines. Reading experience is so superior, it's hard to describe. To rephrase one of our customers' review, ""try it, and you'll see."" While you're at it, give our PDF Reflow feature a try. You'll be surprised how much better PDF reading goes when you don't have to scroll left/right all the time, for every single line of text.
Annotating PDFs is another star feature of our app. Adding notes and drawings, highlighting text, and then sharing your annotated files or annotation summaries will be your main productivity and collaboration asset.

-= File Management =-
While reading files is a big part of GoodReader, it's not all it can do. It can also serve as a central hub for all your files, even those that can't be opened by GoodReader itself. It's like bringing your personal computer experience to your mobile device — easily managing huge collections of files and folders will make you forget you don't have your laptop around.

And it's completely independent from the built-in Apple's Data Protection, so even if a hacker steals and unlocks your device, your data will still be protected by another strong layer of security, our own.

-= Split-Screen =-
This wonderful feature allows you to split (*) an iPad screen in half, to read two files side-by-side. And even two different parts of the same file!

TESTIMONIALS:

""What a great tool! It’s sleek, intuitive, and easy. Being able to design a fixed layout picture book right on the iPad makes total sense. Highly recommended."" 
- Liz Castro, Author of ‘EPUB Straight to the Point: Creating ebooks for the Apple iPad and other ereaders’

""The app is super intuitive! I was working on a book for my 7 year old niece (who lives in Brazil) in no time. It took me about 30 minutes to put together a book for her, publish in iBooks and email the ePub file to my brother…to open it up on his iPad…. for my niece to read it.""

This boards can be easily integrated into any project, but they can also be used as 4 channels voltmeter to integrate the lab measurement instruments.
Working on complex projects having an additional instrument with a good precision may be extremely helpful.
GUI-1256 is an iOS and macOS application which transforms a simple ADS1256 board in an additional lab instrument, Bluetooth BLE enabled.
GUI-1256 main features are:
•	4 Differential voltage measurements. Without any additional components the ADS1256 can read 4 voltages of +/- 3V max.
•	Bluetooth connection to the measurement device, allowing to get remote measurements
•	Enabling and disabling any of the 4 available channels
•	Optional synthesize voice which reads the measurements, allowing to get measurements without looking at the iOS or macOS device
•	Shifting and scaling. Each of the 4 measurement channels can be independently scaled and shifted
•	Mathematical Expressions. The measurements can used in mathematical expressions to get other quantities. For example, a temperature sensor voltage can be read, and an expression can be used to directly transform the voltage into the temperature
•	Graphs (iOS 16 or greater only). Each of the 4 channels and the expressions can be shown as graphs.
•	Two points calibration to get even more precise measurements
•	Firmware Over The Air Update. The firmware can be update or upgraded directly from the application. First installation requires Arduino IDE and some additional software components available for free","Productivity,Business",GUI-1256,$3.99

Want to challenge your logical skills? Then take a look at Save Balls —  a logic puzzle game in which you should draw a line to protect balls.  

Draw lines, scribbles, figures and doodles. Let your imagination run wild and create a protective masterpiece with one finger. Be careful: the number of lines is limited and different at each level. Remember about  the test of strength: the wasps will be looking for every possible way to get to our poor heroes. Can you create a safe haven and save the emoji? 

Save Balls is an amusing logic game that will test your IQ and raise your intellectual abilities to a new level. It will be harder and harder to protect the smiley balls. New brick fences and moving obstacles will appear, and the space below will fill with water — be careful and don't let a round character fall there. Plan every step, estimate a possible outcome and build tactical strategies to save the emoji. Solve logical puzzles, pass interesting levels and open bonus levels.

Collect coins and exchange them for other fun characters: a cool punk, a cute piggy, a cat and even a space alien. Customize your heroes: wear a cowboy hat, a helmet, earflaps, a sombrero, a cap, a crown or other fun accessories. You can also choose the color of the defensive line: red, blue, green and any other to your taste. This brain puzzle will improve not only logical, but also creative skills. Adjust the game to your mood and start the emoji rescue operation. 

Сollect golden keys — use them to open the treasure chest. Gold coins and skill stars will be inside. These stars will help you to increase your rating in the game. The more you play, the more stars you have and the higher your rating is. Train your brain and pass the way from a beginner to a guru in the world of teasers and physics games.
  
Joyful music and fun voices will cheer everyone up, and emotional faces won't leave anyone indifferent. You will never get bored with this game: it is constantly updated with interesting levels, characters and accessories for them. 
 
Take a break from the hustle and bustle of everyday life — have fun and enjoy.

- SSTP (MS-SSTP)
- SoftEther VPN

Note that we do not provide any server or subscription. You need to specify the server you are connecting to.

• Simplicity
VPN clients ought to be small and simple. Therefore we don't place ads, analytics or other 3rd-party SDK in the app. Size can tell.

• Native
To the extent possible, native iOS libraries are used, including most importantly the TLS stack. We believe this ensures best stability and security. (Apple's SwiftNIO framework is also used.)
Unlike some apps, SSTP Connect saves connections natively so that you can start a connection from the system. No need to open the app and it will work just the same.

• Privacy
Please read our privacy policy. We promise that no data is collected from you. Moreover, connection log only exists in the memory and is never saved to the device.

• Authentication Methods
Password and certificate-based authentication is supported for both protocols. (iOS 12+ required for certificate authentication in SSTP)
SSTP authentication methods: PEAP, EAP-TLS, EAP-MSCHAPv2, MSCHAPv2, CHAP, PAP
SoftEther authentication methods: Password (including RADIUS / NT Domain), Certificate

• Security
Your passwords and certificates are only stored in the iOS keychain. SSTP Connect never saves them locally for convenience or other reasons.

• IPv6 Ready
IPv6 is not the next generation. It's now and SSTP Connect is ready for that.
Of course server connections are IPv6 ready but there is more. VPN tunnel is also IPv6 capable (stateless only, DHCPv6 not yet supported), provided the server has IPv6 configured.

• More than TCP (SoftEther Only)
You can use the advanced NAT traversal (NAT-T) and UDP acceleration technology, just like you do with the official client. (iOS 12+ required)

• Easy Import (SoftEther Only)
Wondering how to copy VPN connections from the official SoftEther client? SSTP Connect can read connection setting files (.vpn) so import work is a piece of cake.

• Routing
Accept pushed static routes from the server or add your own entries. Full control!

Supported Server Platforms
• Microsoft Windows Server 2008 and later
• Microsoft Azure P2S VPN
• MikroTik RouterOS*
• SoftEther VPN Server
• VPN Azure

* Servers configured without certificates are not supported.

SSTP Connect is a third-party implementation based on Microsoft Open Specifications and SoftEther VPN source code. We do not have any affiliation with either Microsoft Corporation or SoftEther Corporation.","Utilities,Productivity",SSTP Connect,$2.99

Combining open-world gameplay with a character driven narrative, you arrive in a town brimming with delights and degradation and given the opportunity to take it over as you choose.

• Beautifully updated graphics, character models and lighting effects 
• New, precisely tailored firing and targeting options 
• Custom controls with a fully customizable layout 
• iCloud save game support 
• Massive campaign with countless hours of gameplay

...Who is Agent Ray really working for and will she get what they want?
...What does Junior Agent Reyes know about a 20 year old factory fire that he’s not saying?

When you shop in the Klarna app, you can split the cost of your purchase from any online store into 4 smaller, interest-free payments. And it works just as easily in-store, with Apple Pay. So you can get what you love today and pay later.

NEW DEALS EVERY DAY.

GET PRICE DROP ALERTS.
Save items in Collections and never pay full price again. Each time you save an item, an automatic price drop alert is set. That way, when the price drops you will know. You can also share your Collections with family and friends.

PERSONALIZED INSPIRATION.
In Klarna’s Inspiration feed, you’ll find carefully curated suggestions for deals, product collections, complete looks, and editorials tailored to your shopping. It doesn’t matter if you love fashion, beauty, tech, or whatever – we’ve got something for you.

INCREASE YOUR SPENDING LIMIT.
The more you shop and pay later in 4 installments with Klarna and pay back on time, the more purchasing power you unlock which allows you to spend more. And, you'll also gain access to even more exclusive deals and offers!

HASSLE-FREE RETURNS. 
Need to send something back? Report a return right in the app. We’ll pause your purchase so you don’t have to pay in the meantime.

By analyzing the workout data stored in Apple Health, HealthFit provides the kind of indispensable tracking and insights you normally only get from premium subscription services. But if you still prefer to use apps like Strava or Training Peaks, HealthFit has you covered with reliable automated background syncing.

ONE FITNESS APP THAT DOES IT ALL

HealthFit combines a comprehensive activity feed with insightful fitness statistics and all your essential health metrics in one beautifully designed app. So you don’t need to go hunting around in multiple apps to track your fitness progress.

SYNC YOUR WORKOUTS SEAMLESSLY

Syncing with platforms like Strava can be a fiddly, laborious process and the results aren’t always great. HealthFit solves this by syncing automatically in the background after every workout. So you don’t have to lift a finger, it just works. It can even sync your entire workout history.

With support for more than 25 platforms (see below), HealthFit is fitness hub, keeping all your workout data in sync.

WORKOUTS: THE ACTIVITY FEED YOU REALLY NEED

Browse your workouts in the Activity Feed, with route maps, photos and essential stats all visible at a glance. Tap on a workout for a treasure trove of essential insights, like customizable Heart Rate Zones, Training Load and Recovery Times. You can even log which bike or shoes you use, to monitor usage and flag when it’s time to replace them.

HealthFit finds photos you take during your workouts automatically, bringing your activity feed to life with stunning images you can share on social media.

RUNNING POWER ANALYSIS

HealthFit provides advanced running power analysis with the automatically estimated critical power, the weighted average power, the power distribution chart by 25W Increments and the mean maximal power chart which shows your best average power for time periods of one second up to the length of your run.

MULTISPORT AND INTERVAL WORKOUTS

HealthFit is the only app to export multisport workouts as multisession activities

STATISTICS: UNCOVER HIDDEN FITNESS INSIGHTS

Apple Watch gathers so much fitness data, it can sometimes seem overwhelming. HealthFit mines that data to provide essential charts and summaries that show you exactly how you’re doing, with indispensable insights that will help you to raise your fitness game.

Stats are broken down by activity type, with handy Year Comparison charts. You can monitor changes in your Fitness (CTL), Fatigue (ALT), and Form (TSB), Heat Maps reveal where you’ve been training, and your Explorer Score reveals how much you’ve been getting around.

HEALTH METRICS: THE STATS THAT MATTER

HealthFit provides a curated view of your health metrics focusing on the essential stats every athlete needs to know, whether you’re a serious competitor, a weekend warrior, or just beginning your fitness journey.

TAILORED TO YOUR FAVORITE FITNESS ACTIVITIES

Unlike most fitness apps, HealthFit doesn't just focus on running and cycling. We treat all activity types equally, presenting your most frequent activity types more prominently, with specially tailored stats and charts.

UNBEATABLE ON PRIVACY

All your data stays on your iPhone where it belongs. Our app runs on your phone, not in the cloud. We don’t use any trackers to monitor your activity and we never will.

About AutoSleep
-----------------
Using Advanced Heuristics AutoSleep works out how long you've slept so you don't have to.

If you DO wear your Watch to bed, you don't need to do a single thing. AutoSleep will track your sleep & quality and send you a notification in the morning.

Even if you don't wear your Watch to bed, AutoSleep can track your time in bed. It's extremely simple.

If you DON'T wear your Watch to bed, then simply take your Watch off before you go to sleep. As soon as you touch your iPhone or put your Watch back on in the morning then AutoSleep will know that you have finished sleeping. 

As everyone is a little bit different. AutoSleep provides a simple setup wizard and an option to tweak if you are a very restless sleeper. 

If you wear your Apple Watch to bed*, AutoSleep will also analyse your sleep quality. By using time asleep, restlessness, time awake and heart rate it can score the quality of your sleep and provide you with a comprehensive nightly analysis. 
*Note. If you do not wear your Watch to bed, AutoSleep simply captures the amount of time sleeping. 

AutoSleep also works with HeartWatch our premier heart & activity monitoring app and writes your Sleep information to Apple Health. 

*Requires Apple Watch running Watch OS 4 or higher. WatchOS 5 recommended.

Apple Sleep Stages

Tikkie lets your friends pay you back quickly and easily over WhatsApp, Telegram, Messenger or by text message. And it’s really easy to transfer money with Tikkie, no matter where you bank. Anyone can use Tikkie!


When to use Tikkie
Tikkie comes in handy when you have paid for someone else and you want your money back, or when someone else has paid for you and you need to pay them back. Whether it’s a one-off purchase or various different group expenses, Tikkie can be used in any situation. You might have paid for: 
•	drinks with your club friends; 
•	a present for a colleague; 
•	festival tickets; 
•	weekend away with friends; 
•	household expenses in your student house.


Really easy payment requests
Simply use Tikkie to send a payment request over WhatsApp, Telegram or Messenger, by text message, or however else you want. The request will contain a link that your friends can use to pay you back. So you no longer need to exchange account numbers! Your friends don’t need to have Tikkie, but they do need a Dutch current account, and a Dutch, Belgian or German phone number. Tip: you can now also let your friends fill in the amount themselves. That’s handy when different people owe you different amounts.


Track your group expenses and settle up 
Tikkie makes it easy for you to keep track of group expenses too. Create a Groepie, invite your friends, and you’re good to go. All of the group members can add and settle up expenses, with a Tikkie of course! Good to know: your friends need the Tikkie app to join a Groepie.


Unique deals with Tikkie Terug
Get money back from well-known brands thanks to cashback promotions! If you see a QR code in a shop or on an online promotion page, simply scan it with the Tikkie app and get all or part of the purchase price back right away.


iDEAL payments
Your friends pay you back using iDEAL and their own banking app, and the money is paid straight into your current account. Payments through Tikkie also use iDEAL and we don’t charge any transaction fees for this.


For businesses too
If you’re an ABN AMRO business client, make things easy on yourself and your customers by sending a payment request! Tikkie is also available to businesses, from self-employed individuals to multinationals. Your invoices are paid fast and your customers are happy. They don’t need cash, and you don’t need an expensive payment terminal.

Classroom makes it easy for learners and instructors to connect—inside and outside of schools. Classroom saves time and paper, and makes it easy to create classes, distribute assignments, communicate, and stay organized.

Classroom is designed to help teachers create, collect, and grade assignments paperlessly, including time-saving features like the ability to automatically make a copy of a Google Document for each student. It also creates Drive folders for each assignment and for each student to help keep everyone organized.

Students can keep track of what’s due on the Assignments page and begin working with just a click. Teachers can quickly see who has or hasn't completed the work, and provide direct, real-time feedback and grades right in Classroom.

With the mobile app for iOS, students and teachers can view their classes and communicate with their classmates in real time. Students can open their assignments and work on them right from their iPhone or iPad. Teachers can keep track of who has turned in work and grade the assignment - at school or on the go. Students and teachers receive notifications when they have new content in Classroom, so they are always up to date.

There are many benefits of using Classroom:

Easy to set up
Teachers can add students directly or share a code with their class to join. It takes just minutes to set up.

Saves time
The simple, paperless assignment workflow allows teachers to create, review, and grade assignments quickly, all in one place.

Enhances communication

The two calculators are sharing one input keyboard and the calculation process and results are displayed in two separate windows.

This calculator is especially suitable for the following use scenarios:
1. Comparative calculation (for example, when shopping online, we want to calculate and compare the unit price of the same commodity in different stores);
2. A complex mathematical operation in which some expressions in the middle need to be operated first. Through this app, one calculator can calculate the main formula, and the other one can calculate the subformula. The result of the subformula calculation can be directly output to the main formula calculator.
3. Dual-Calc has more powerful functions and more reasonable experience than the system calculator, which can completely replace the system calculator.


【 Features 】
1. Results can be exported from one calculator to another.
2. For the convenience of users, we provide two ways to switch calculators. The only difference between the two ways is whether the results of the previous calculator are automatically brought to the next one during the switching process:
    a. Click on the ⇅(⇋) button, will switch calculator, at the same time the result of the current calculator will be output to the other one.
    b. You can switch calculators by clicking the top two calculators directly, but the calculation results will not be automatically output at this time.
3. Provide standard calculation mode under portrait and rotate the screen to landscape it will become a scientific calculator.
4. Long press the calculation result label to copy it to the system paste board.

Dabei werden Konzentration und  Wahrnehmung, Augenbewegung und Blickspanne trainiert. Dies fördert die Sicherheit bei der Worterfassung und verbessert die Lesefähigkeit  der Kinder.  Die liebevoll gestalteten und temporeichen  Übungen bieten zusätzlich viel  Aktion und Spielspaß so dass Lesetraining ganz nebenbei erfolgt! Durch das Spielen gegen die Zeit werden die Kinder zum Verbessern ihres Highscores und damit zum häufigen Wiederholen motiviert.

Die 7 Lesespiele fördern zentrale Lesefertigkeiten

Punkte jagen 
Mit den Augen wird ein schnell wandernder Punkt verfolgt, der ab und zu seine Farbe ändert. Diese Übung trainiert die Konzentrationsfähigkeit  sowie eine gleichmäßige und schnelle Augenbewegung.  Gleichzeitig werden die reflexhafte Reaktion und Blicksprünge geübt.  Denn bei einem flüssigen und schnellen Lesen bewegen sich die Augen nicht gleichmäßig von Buchstabe zu Buchstabe, sondern sie springen von einem Haltepunkt zum nächsten. 

Blitzwörter
Es wird ein Wort gezeigt, welches nach kurzer Zeit wieder verschwindet.  Dieses Wort soll aus einer Auswahl von drei Wörtern wiedererkannt werden.
Diese Übung trainiert das ganzheitliche Erfassen und das Wiedererkennen  der Wortgestalt von ein- und zweisilbigen Wörtern  Dadurch kann das Kind Wörter schneller erfassen, sodass seine Leseflüssigkeit zunimmt. 

Wortpaare
Aus einer  Anzahl von  Wortpaaren sollen die ungleichen  Wortpaare erkannt und angetippt werden. 
Diese Übung trainiert die Lesegeschwindigkeit bekannter und unbekannter Wörter. Die Wörter werden als Bilder wahrgenommen und werden nicht Buchstabe für Buchstabe mühsam erlesen. 

Wortgitter
In einem Buchstabenfeld soll  möglichst schnell das gesuchte Wort zweimal wiedergefunden werden.  
Diese Übung trainiert die Wortauffassung und die Diskrimination von Wortbildern. 


Bücherwurm
In einem Kontinuum von sich bewegenden Konsonanten sollen  möglichst schnell die gesuchten Wörter  erlesen werden. 
Diese Übung trainiert die Erfassung von Wortgrenzen. 

Bildersuche 
In einem Bild sollen möglichst schnell die gesuchten Ausschnitte gefunden und angetippt werden.
Diese Übung trainiert die horizontale Blickführung und die visuelle Wahrnehmung. Das Kind muss genau hinsehen und sich konzentrieren. Die Blickspanne wird erweitert, wodurch der Lesefluss verbessert und ein schnelles sowie sicheres Lesen möglich wird.  

Ballonspiel
Diese Übung  trainiert die Blickspanne und die Konzentration. Das Auge der Kinder muss über das gesamte Spielfeld wandern, da immer neue Ballons hinzukommen. Durch den konzentrierten Blick und das Lesen muss in kurzer Zeit wahrgenommen werden, ob der Buchstabe an dem Ballon zu dem Wort  in dem Ballon passt. Erste Lesefertigkeiten und –fähigkeiten werden darüber gefördert. 

Die Punkte, die die Kinder in der Antolin Lesepiele-App erzielen, werden nicht  dem Punktekonto auf www.antolin.de zugerechnet.

Pelvic health specialists around the world recommend Squeezy to their patients every day because it works.

Around 30,000 people use Squeezy regularly to help them remember to do their pelvic floor muscle exercises. So if you are thinking about downloading Squeezy for your pelvic floor, you are not alone. 

All women should be doing these exercises and some will be doing them as part of a physiotherapy programme.

Squeezy is simple to use, informative and designed to help women to remember to do their pelvic floor muscle exercises (also known as Kegel exercises). 

Features includes:
• A pre-set exercise plan that follows public health guidelines
• A record of the number of exercises you have completed, compared to your target
• Visual and audio guides for exercises
• Exercise reminders with customisable settings
• Educational information about the pelvic floor
• “Professional mode” – if working with a pelvic health specialist, you can tailor the exercise plan to fit your needs
• A bladder diary to keep track of your symptoms, if required
• Simple and clear interface

Squeezy has been clinically reviewed and approved by the NHS for its clinical safety, and is compliant with NHS Information Governance requirements.

Squeezy won several industry awards including ehi Awards 2016, Health Innovation Network 2016, National Continence Care Awards 2015/16 and was a finalist for awards including Advancing Healthcare Awards 2014 and 2017, Abbvie Sustainable Healthcare Awards 2016.

For more about Squeezy and additional pelvic health information visit squeezyapp.com.

*Apple Watch users*
During your exercises you need to hold your finger on your Apple Watch face to keep it live and running. The play button changes to state ‘Hold’ when running an exercise.

This keeps your Watch from dozing off while your attention is focused on your pelvic floor. Most Watch screens go to sleep after 7 or 15 seconds (time dependent on your Watch settings). Squeezy has no control over the screen sleep time on the Watch; it has to obey your Watch settings. 

We hope to be able to improve the Watch experience in future. In the meantime, we’re continuing the existing Watch support because many people find it helpful.

If you have feedback on the Apple Watch, please get in touch with the developers directly on help@squeezyapp.com.

As seen on Cbeebies.

This app helps your child get to grips with addition, number bonds and other key number skills. Find the hidden Numberblocks, add them together and see what happens. 

● Every time you get to Ten, you win something new to play with.

► Play hide and seek! Tap on the Numberblocks when they poke their heads out.

► When you have found two Numberblocks, drag one on top of the other to start the number magic. 

► Predict what will happen when you add them together - if you don’t know, take a guess.

► Make the number magic happen yourself: drag both Numberblocks into the white shape. Watch the number magic happen.      
                  
► Keep finding more Numberblocks and adding them on until you make a Ten.               

► An animation plays to celebrate every time you make Ten.         

► You will also discover a new interactive plaything in the park. Try playing with it!

As you keep playing, the sums get gradually harder and the Numberblocks try out new number shapes. This helps children get better at recognising amounts on sight. If a Numberblock looks unfamiliar, try counting their blocks!

Keep going to fill the park with playthings. After discovering all 20, you can restart the game and play again. Repeat play is a great way to get better at your number bonds and predicting which Numberblocks you will make.","Education,Games,Puzzle,Family",Numberblocks: Hide and Seek,$2.99

Manual controls, better video, long exposure and quick access to the settings we need. It gives us the features of a DSLR but in a fast, easy to use camera app.

For Filmmakers - the features you need, not the ones you don’t. Color profiles, bitrates, dual-channel audio meters, real-time waveforms, and fast access to frame rates.

For Photographers - easier than shooting on your DSLR. Shoot in RAW (even in BURST), split focus / exposure, and manually control everything (exposure, iso, shutter speed, white balance and focus).

For Everyone Else - inspired by the pro’s we made the interface simple, fast, and easy to use. We provide getting started tips, video tutorials, and full time customer service to get you setup.

We love hearing from you. If you have any features, ideas, or feedback please email us at hello@shopmoment.com or DM us on Instagram @moment.

Enter the data of the environment in which you want to install the air conditioning unit and obtain the minimum necessary value of the capacity in Btu & ton.

This application is a must for any plumber, builder or home DIY enthusiast, in fact anyone who wants to find out what radiator or AC BTU's are required for a particular room size.

This calculator has the added benefit of showing you the BTU required and also the kW required.

This calculator is designed to give an approximate size for an adequate room air conditioner unit capable of cooling the room you have described in your entry. Select entries from the drop data boxes for the room size and amount of room insulation. Select yes or no values for DIRECT sun exposure and if the room is a kitchen. Morning sun exposure is not usually a problem, however afternoon sun exposure often adds up to 15 degrees to a room. Our selection of a kitchen is based on added heat potential to a room. You may wish to try both selection if you are in question to see if there is a change in the suggested cooling required. If you are on the borderline of two potential units and there is no major price difference, we suggest the larger cooling capacity.",Utilities,Air Condition Size Calculator,$1.99

Forget the days of awkward online dating and become a POF member, where you can come exactly as you are. We’re here to help you create the same magic online that you would IRL. 

We know online dating isn’t one-size-fits-all, so we let you choose your own adventure and connect with other singles in a way that feels right for you. Whether you’re into spicy dating games, live streaming, or sending a good-old-fashioned DM, we’ve got lots of options to make finding your person actually fun.

What you can do on POF is what makes us different:
       - Play a dating game and have a laugh while doing it
       - Search for exactly what you want
       - Join a stream on Plenty of Fish Live! and meet others like you

Arma Tactics takes the best from the popular strategy genre... and goes mobile. The finest assets used in the critically acclaimed Arma™ series on PC now come to life on the mobile platforms, in one of the best looking mobile games to date.

Arma Tactics is a turn-based close-combat strategy game, where the player takes control of a four-member Special Forces team. There are no given strategies, rails to move on, or paths to follow; it‘s up to the player to decide how he will play through  both the story-driven missions and generated missions with randomized objectives. Whether using stealth or a more direct approach, players will need to use their strategic thinking and use both basic and advanced weaponry while facing many different opponents - ranging from unorganized local militia to smart and skilled mercenaries.

With highly replayable missions, achievements, weapons to unlock and whole campaigns to be regularly added, Arma Tactics offers many hours of intense ever-changing action.

And answering the questions after each meditation will help you gain an improved understanding of your own meditation process!

Freya will coach you through every single surge with a simple breathing technique and visualisation. She will help you relax between surges with a mix of guided relaxations, positive affirmations, gentle music and calming visualisations. Freya makes it easy for you to keep track of your surges and you can visit the log at any point to see how frequently your surges are coming and how long they are lasting. Freya will also let you know when your labour is established and when it might be a good time to contact your midwife. You will never birth alone with Freya by your side.
 
TRACK YOUR SURGES

In hypnobirthing we refer to contractions as surges, as a ‘surge’ more accurately describes the sensation you’ll experience when in labour. Freya is the ONLY hypnobirthing-friendly contraction timer on the app store, designed specifically with hypnobirthing mums in mind, but can be used by anyone.
 
PREPARE FOR BIRTH

You can also use Freya in pregnancy to help you relax and prepare for your birth. In fact the more you listen to the guided relaxations and positive affirmations, the more familiar they will become and the more effective they will be at helping you relax when it comes to birth. Positive affirmations have been proven to change the way your mind works and listening regularly will help you feel less anxious and more confident in the lead up to birth. 
 
THE SCIENCE

We know the more relaxed you are during birth, the more oxytocin you will produce. Oxytocin helps your uterus to work efficiently, making labour faster and more comfortable. 
 
LIFESKILLS

You can also use Freya post-birth any time you feel you could benefit from taking some deep breaths or need some help finding your zen. Everything you learn through using Freya - mindfulness exercises, breathing techniques, the benefits of taking time out - are skills for life.

If you have any questions or spot any pesky bugs lurking about the place (!) please do let us know at help@thepositivebirthcompany.co.uk

WHAT YOU’LL GET:

iPhone and Apple Watch app
A timer to record your surges (also known as a contraction timer)
Coaching audio to keep your mind focused on breathing through each surge
A gentle expanding visualisation which you can use to sync your breathing
A detailed log of your surges over time, so you can track your progress through labour
Ability to easily share the log with your birth partner, midwife or doula
Guided relaxations, positive affirmations and soothing visuals to help keep you calm and relaxed, making birth easier, quicker and more straightforward (can also be used in pregnancy and postnatally)

-- ABOUT THE GAME --

You just got a new job at Papa's Donuteria in the whimsical town of Powder Point!  The pay and benefits are nice, but you took the job for that coveted Line-Jump Pass for the amusement park right outside the shop.  It's not all fun and games though: Now you also have to cook delicious donuts every day for all of the crazy customers in this carnival-like town.

You'll need to prepare donuts using a variety of doughs and shapes, then toss them in the fryer and cook both sides until they're just right.  Finish the delicious donuts with tasty fillings, icing, and toppings before serving them to your hungry customers.  First-time visitors may just order one donut to try, but repeat customers can't get enough and will start ordering more donuts when they visit!  Powder Point also celebrates different holidays year-round, so get ready to unlock new festive ingredients as you play through the holidays!

-- GAME FEATURES --

NEW FEATURES - All of your favorite features from other versions of Papa's restaurants are now available in this ""To Go"" game, redesigned and reimagined for smaller screens!

You'll unlock new donut shapes, fillings, icing, drizzles, and toppings for each holiday of the year, and your customers will love trying new tasty flavors.

SERVE SPECIAL RECIPES - Earn Special Recipes from your customers, and serve them as the Daily Special in the Donuteria!  Each Special has a bonus you can earn for serving a prime example of that recipe.  Master each special to earn a special prize!

CUSTOMIZE YOUR WORKERS - Play as Tony or Scooter, or create your own custom character to work in the donut shop!  You can also show off your holiday spirit with a massive variety of holiday outfits and clothing for your workers.  Choose unique color combinations for each item of clothing, and create your own style with millions of combinations!

SPECIAL DELIVERY - Some customers don't want to come all the way to the amusement park to get their donut fix!  When you start taking phone orders, customers can call to place their donut order, and you'll hire a Driver to help take and deliver orders to their homes instead!

COLLECT STICKERS - Complete a variety of tasks and achievements while playing to earn colorful Stickers for your collection.  Each customer has a set of three favorite Stickers: Earn all three and you'll be rewarded with a brand-new outfit to give to that customer!

DECORATE THE SHOP - Customize the Donuteria lobby with themed furniture and decorations for each holiday of the year!  Mix and match your favorite styles, or add items that match the current holiday so customers won't mind waiting longer for their food.

CLIPPING COUPONS - Missing your favorite customer?  Send them a coupon with the help of your friendly mailman, Vincent!  Customers love a good deal, and will promptly arrive to order another meal.  Coupons are great for completing quests for Stickers and for strategically leveling up customers!

It’s a new era in tech. Don’t settle for a browser produced by giant, profit-driven, data-hoarding tech companies. Firefox is the obvious choice for independent, ethical tech that respects your privacy and gives you more ways than ever to tailor your internet experience exactly the way you want it. Download Firefox now for iPhone, iPad and Mac.

Firefox is backed by the non-profit Mozilla Foundation, whose mission is to ensure the internet remains a global public resource, open and accessible to everyone. When you make Firefox your go-to, everyday browser, you’re also joining a unique (serious nerd cred) community that’s actively helping to diversify the way people experience the internet.  

Firefox is extremely private for a reason — and the reason is you. 
We want you to have an amazing experience every time you use Firefox. We know feeling safe and secure are foundational for enjoying your time online. Since version 1 in 2004, we’ve taken privacy seriously, because we’ve always been in the business of valuing people first, over everything. When you care more about people than profits, privacy naturally becomes a top priority.

DIFFERENT DEVICES.  SAME TRAIN OF THOUGHT
Now you can search for things on your laptop, then pick up the exact same search on your phone and vice versa. Your Firefox homepage displays the most recent searches you’ve done on other devices so you can easily get back to what you were doing or thinking about. 

LIMITED-EDITION WALLPAPERS
Introducing limited-edition wallpapers from independent creators. Stick with one you love or switch it up anytime to make Firefox match your mood. 


STREAMLINED HOME SCREEN
Pick up right where you left off. See all your open tabs intuitively grouped and displayed along with your recent bookmarks, top sites and popular articles recommended by Pocket.

PRIVACY CONTROL IN ALL THE RIGHT PLACES
Firefox gives you greater privacy protection while you’re on the web. By default, Firefox blocks trackers and scripts such as social media trackers, cross-site cookie trackers, cryptominers and fingerprinters. In addition to Apple’s Intelligent Tracking Prevention, setting Firefox’s Enhanced Tracking Protection to strict blocks tracking content in all windows. Also, you can easily choose to search in private browsing mode. And when you close private browsing mode, your browsing history and any cookies are automatically erased from your device.

GET FIREFOX ON  ALL YOUR DEVICES
Add Firefox across your devices for secure, seamless browsing. In addition to synced tabs and searches, Firefox makes password management easy by remembering your passwords across devices.

FIND IT FAST WITH FIREFOX’S SEARCH BAR
Get search suggestions in the search bar and quickly access the sites you visit most. Type in your search question and get suggested and previously searched results across your favorite search engines.

ORGANIZE YOUR TABS THE WAY YOU LIKE
Create as many tabs as you like without losing track. Firefox displays your open tabs as thumbnails and numbered tabs, making it easy to find what you want quickly.

SHARE ANYTHING IN A FEW TAPS
The Firefox web browser makes it easy to share links to web pages or specific items on a page with easy, quick access to your most recently used apps.

It's opening day at Griller Stadium, where you're in charge of Papa Louie's famous hot dog stand!  In Papa's Hot Doggeria HD you'll need to grill up juicy hot dogs, top them with a variety of seasonal condiments, and serve them to all of the rowdy fans.  You'll also have your hands full popping up fresh popcorn and pouring refreshing drinks for your hungry customers.  Each station in the restaurant is a hands-on process, and you'll have to multitask to keep up with your orders.  Keep the fans full and happy, cheer on your favorite team, and even take a swing in the Home Run Derby!

-- GAME FEATURES --

Celebrate the seasons with new holiday hot dogs!  As the seasons change at Griller Stadium, your customers will order their hot dogs with new seasonal ingredients and sides.  You'll unlock new buns, drinks, popcorn, sauces, and toppings for each holiday of the year, and your customers will love trying new flavors at the ballgame!

Customers will occasionally bring you unique Special Recipes, which you can serve as the Daily Special at the hot dog stand!  Each Special also has a bonus you can earn for serving a prime example of that recipe.  When you serve enough Specials to master that recipe, you'll also earn a special prize!

A traditional calendar is not always ideal for shift workers. Sometimes it's not easy to see your upcoming shift schedule very clearly, especially if your shifts don't fall into the traditional working week. Shift Worker solves this problem and turns the frustrating task of entry into a quick and easy experience.

Shift Worker allows you to create your own types of shifts by combining visually-attractive icons with letters/numbers so that they can be easily identified at a glance. By including a range of icons (such as suns and stars for day and night shifts) in a variety of colors, any combination is possible for all types of shifts.

Entering shifts can be done quickly by simply selecting a type of shift and tapping on each date it occurs. An entire month of shifts could be entered in seconds, an entire year in a few minutes!

In addition, Shift Worker allows you create multiple calendars to see friends and family shifts! You can send your shifts to others so they can also see your shifts at a glance as an image or in their copy of Shift Worker. To make things even simpler, you can even save your shifts to your iPhone/iPod's background so that referring to your upcoming shift schedule is as simple as picking up your iPhone/iPod. 

Shift Worker also includes the ability to create colored personalized notes for each date. Notes can be used anytime additional information needs to be added to a date.

FEATURES:

- Create a virtually unlimited amount of shift types
- Enter shifts on the calendar months in advance in seconds
- Add your rotation and automatically fill the calendar in a few simple steps
- Show friends and family shifts using multiple calendars
- View the calendar in timeline format to see your shift flow at a glance

The newest release brings many new features including full iPad support, balancing teams based on skill or gender, importing users from a file, enabling video output, and sharing teams via facebook or email. 

Team Shake is the premier iOS App for creating teams. Instead of a hat and scraps of paper, the user enters his friends' names in his iPhone and gives it a shake. The screen will then display a random set of color-coded teams. These teams can immediately be used for game play or shared via facebook or email.   The quick and easy selection of random (or balanced) teams eliminates fighting over who will be on which team. Innovative use of the iPhone shake gesture gives users the satisfying feeling of shaking a virtual hat without the trouble of carrying around an actual hat. Conventional buttons can also be used for those who would rather not shake their expensive hardware about.  

The app is designed with ease of use and simplicity in mind. Names can easily be entered with the onscreen keyboard, chosen from the user's contacts, or imported from a file. The email and facebook functions document the members of each individual team as well as preserving the team number and color assigned by the app. For repeated use of Team Shake, lists of friends can be easily saved and loaded later. The current list is also automatically saved so that if you exit the app, or even reboot the device, changes will not be lost. For teachers and others with large lists of people, Team Shake supports the ability to import teams from text or csv files.

If you have any problems, feature requests, or comments please send an email to support@rhine-o.com. 

Features:

* Create 1 to 64 random teams
* Create completely random or balanced teams
* Full iPad support
* Eliminates fighting over choosing teams
* Share / Save teams via email or Facebook
* Teams can be chosen by the number of teams or by the size of teams.

The perfect egg timer with the incredible egg spy: from now on your eggs will be perfect.

Are you tired of eggs that are always too soft or to hard?
No matter where you are or how big your egg is - the perfect egg timer for perfect eggs is the solution!

The perfect egg-timer is based on scientific proof and because every egg is different, the timer calculates  the exact cooking time  based on egg size, altitude and temperature.

Usage: In order to measure the exact size of your egg, simply place it on your iPhone and set the size using your fingertip for. Determine your current altitude (or let it be determined by GPS), tell your iPhone if you kept your eggs  in the freezer or at room temperature and how you would like to have your eggs – soft-boiled, hard-boiled or something in-between.

Place your eggs in a single layer in a saucepan. Add enough cold water to just cover the eggs. Bring them to a rapid boil over high heat and start the countdown. The iPhone will signal when the eggs are done. The attraction: The egg spy lets you see the changes inside your boiling egg!

Features:

-the formula for the perfect egg-timer is based on physical experiments and studies

- Egg-size can be adjusted to the nearest millimetre (inch): Simply place the egg on the iPhone scale and set the size with your fingertip.  It doesn’t get any more accurate than this. 

- Automatic change of measurement units between inch or millimeter and fahrenheit or celsisu, depending on language and international settings.

- determine and enter your altitude manually or let it be determined by GPS automatically.
- The egg-spy shows you the inside of your egg during the cooking progress","Food & Drink,Lifestyle",The perfect Egg timer,$0.99

Are you traveling on a plane and need a quick power nap? Does your newborn baby wake up in the middle of the night? There are numerous benefits to using White Noise:

• Helps you sleep by blocking distractions
• Relaxes and reduces stress
• Pacifies fussy and crying babies
• Increases focus while enhancing privacy
• Soothes headaches and migraines
• Masks tinnitus (ringing of the ears)

Even when you’re asleep, your brain is constantly scanning and listening for sounds. If it’s too quiet, unwanted noises such as faucet drips or police sirens can interrupt your sleep. White Noise generates sounds over a wide range of frequencies, masking those noise interruptions, so you can not only fall asleep, but stay asleep.

Users can post once per day, and can only keep a certain post alive once.

Privacy plays a central role on Keep It Alive. Users can have different kinds of relationships with others (acquaintances, friends, romantic partners, family, professionals), and can choose what about them is shown to each group as well as who can send them messages, and so much more.

Keep It Alive also features a coin system where users can gain or lose coins depending on what they do in the app. These coins are not currency, but rather a point system used to rank users compared to each other. Applying to keep a post alive requires coins, just as leaving comments also requires coins. On the other hand, successfully keeping a post alive will reward the user coins. These coins cannot be bought, sold, or traded with others.

Picture yourself waking up as your smart lights gently rise. Your favorite songs play on the speakers and you still haven't gotten out of bed. How lovely, right? Smart products like lighting, speakers, blinds and air purifiers can make a lovely addition to your everyday life. When you improve the IQ of your home, life itself runs a bit smoother.

The magic happens when you combine two or more smart products from IKEA, tell them what to do in the app and save it as a 'Scene'.

A great scene is one you will use often. Think about waking up and going to bed, cooking and eating, date night and family time, or leaving and coming home. All everyday moments when we can support you with the best lighting, sound that suits your mood, and cleaner air.

When it comes to control, we think of everyone, from young to old and even visitors. So while the app gives you total control to customize your smart home, our range of remotes make it easy for everyone to live with and use a smart home.

In control 
• You can control products individually or in groups. You can turn whole rooms on and off or the whole home, all at once.
• Dim and change light colours, adjust blinds, speaker volume, and much more.
• Set the scenes you need and trigger them with schedules, a shortcut button or use the app.

Easy to use
• The home screen gives a fast overview of your whole home. Quickly control products, access rooms, or start/stop scenes. This is also where you add new products, rooms, and scenes.

With one download, you get a new everyday browser that offers seamless protection while you search and browse, and even access to tracking protection for emails you receive.

Protecting your privacy online is like protecting your home. Locking the front door won’t stop the most determined folks from getting inside, especially if you’ve left the back door and windows unlocked and an extra key under the doormat. That’s why we offer multiple types of privacy protection, most of which aren’t offered in most popular browsers by default.

FEATURE HIGHLIGHTS
• Search Privately by Default — DuckDuckGo Private Search comes built-in, so you can easily search the web without being tracked.

• Escape Website Trackers Before They Load  — Automatically stop most hidden trackers (3rd-party scripts) from loading, which prevents companies from collecting and using (e.g. sale, ads, etc.) any data from these trackers. Our cutting-edge tracker blocking technology – called 3rd-Party Tracker Loading Protection – goes above and beyond what you get in most popular browsers by default.

• Automatically Enforce Encryption — force many sites you visit to automatically use an encrypted (HTTPS) connection, which helps shield your data from Wi-Fi snoopers and network onlookers like your Internet provider. 

• Enable Built-in Email Protection — Over 85% of emails sent to Duck Addresses contained trackers that can detect when you’ve opened a message, where you were when you opened it, and what device you were using. Email Protection makes it easy to block most email trackers and hide your existing address when signing up for things online, all without switching email providers.

• Escape Fingerprinting — help stop companies from creating a unique identifier for you by blocking their attempts to combine specific information about your browser and device settings.

• Block Tracking Cookies — prevent most 3rd-party cookies from tracking you as you browse from site to site.

We also have many protections not available on most browsers including protection from link tracking, Google AMP tracking, and more.

EVERYDAY PRIVACY CONTROLS
• Tap Fire Button, Burn Data — Clear your tabs and browsing data with our Fire Button.

• Signal Your Privacy Preference with Global Privacy Control (GPC) — built-into our app, GPC intends to help you express your opt-out rights automatically by telling websites not to sell or share your personal information. Whether it can be used to enforce your legal rights (for example, current or future CCPA, GDPR requirements) depends on the laws in your jurisdiction.

Note about our 3rd-Party Tracker Loading Protection following DuckDuckGo ad clicks: Our 3rd-Party Tracker Protection goes above and beyond what you get in most popular browsers by default, but we’re constantly working to make it more comprehensive. Currently, if an advertiser wants to detect conversions on their own website for our private DuckDuckGo search ads, our 3rd-Party Tracker Loading Protection will not stop bat.bing.com requests from loading on the advertiser’s website following DuckDuckGo ad clicks, but those requests are stopped in all other contexts. This is because DuckDuckGo private search advertising is in partnership with Microsoft. As part of that partnership, viewing ads on DuckDuckGo is anonymous and Microsoft has committed to not profile our users’ ad clicks.

Head to the Order Station to watch for customers waiting in the lobby.  Switch to the Build Station to combine ice cream and mixables for each sundae.  Jump to the Mix Station to mix sundaes until they're blended just right.  Hop to the Top Station to pour whipped cream and toppings before serving the sundae to your picky customers.  Each Station is a hands-on experience, where you'll need to drag, swipe, and tap your way through the sundae-building process.

Keep your customers happy to earn points and level up.  As your level rises, you'll unlock new toppings for the shop, and new customers will start to visit the Freezeria!  A well-crafted sundae also earns you tips, which you can spend on upgrades and decorations for the lobby!

** NEW FOR PAPA'S FREEZERIA TO GO**

Papa's Freezeria To Go is redesigned and reimagined for smaller screens, so your fingers won't get in the way of the action!

CONTROL WITH YOUR THUMBS - You'll switch stations using buttons in the corners of the screen, perfect for your thumbs.  You can also use buttons in the top corners to quickly switch Order Tickets, and you can view all of your Order Tickets in a zoomed-in mode for easy reading.

BUILD STATION - We've completely redesigned the Build Station for smaller screens.  The Pour Button and Bonus Meter are moved to the side and sized just right for your thumb, so you can watch the meter and tap at the right time without any fingers blocking your view.  When it's time to choose a mixable or a syrup, the entire screen is filled with large buttons so you can easily tap the correct item.

MIX STATION - We've fine-tuned the Mix Station upgrades to work even better on small touch screens.  Once you purchase the Blend Alarm upgrades, you can drag these large alarms and snap them onto any blender.  Booster Buttons are also large and easy to press, and you can even use multi-touch to boost multiple blenders at once!

TOP STATION - The Topping Bin carousel from ""Papa's Burgeria To Go!"" is back, which lets you top sundaes in a brand-new way!  Swipe the carousel of Topping Bins to choose the item you want to use, then grab the sundae cup to start pouring toppings evenly across the sundae.  You can also tap a button to switch to placeable items like cherries and cookies.  And with full multi-touch support, you can keep one finger sliding the bins and another tapping on the cup below, so you'll have those sundaes finished in no time!

NEW INGREDIENTS - We've added a ton of new ingredients that can't be found in the classic or HD versions of the game, including mixables, syrups, whipped cream flavors, and other toppings that you'll unlock as you play the game.  There's over 70 unique ingredients for you to discover!

**GAME FEATURES**

It’s much more than just a tuner!
      
So what makes the TonalEnergy the best selling music practice app?
 
• It's an all-in-one app, with a state-of-the-art tuner, an advanced metronome, dedicated orchestral strings and guitar tuning page, a piano keyboard, sound analysis pages, and audio/visual recording capabilities.

Peppa Pig is the globally acclaimed animated TV show adored by pre-schoolers around the world. Peppa is a loveable, but slightly bossy little pig who lives with Mummy Pig, Daddy Pig, and her little brother George. The series has charmed children and their parents with its warmth, humour, familiarity and simplicity as it follows the family going about their everyday lives. Peppa likes playing with her friends, going to school, learning ballet, visiting Granny and Grandpa Pig and looking after George, but most of all she loves jumping in muddy puddles.

Mobile Passport Control streamlines your U.S. Customs and Border Protection processing experience. Simply fill out your profile and answer CBP’s questions – then go straight to the “Mobile Passport Control” lane at the airport. 

CBP Mobile Passport Control is a voluntary program which can be used by U.S. Citizens and Canadian citizen visitors at any of the supported airport and seaport locations found on our website: https://www.cbp.gov/travel/us-citizens/mobile-passport-control 

CBP Mobile Passport Control can be used in 5 simple steps:
1.) Eligible traveler(s) download the application and create a profile(s) using biographic information from their passport(s) and take a “selfie”; all eligible members in a family group can create a profile, submit their CBP form (up to 12 eligible members per trip), and store their information completely free to be used for future travel.
2.) Upon landing, travelers select their method of travel, port of entry and terminal, answer CBP inspection related questions, certify the truthfulness and accuracy of their answers, and submit their profiles and responses to CBP.
3.) Once submitted, CBP sends an encrypted Quick Response (QR) code back to the traveler’s device.
4.) Travelers proceed to the MPC designated queue upon arrival and present their QR code to a CBP Officer along with their passport.  Please note: MPC does not replace your passport; your passport will need to be presented to the CBP Officer. 
5.) The CBP Officer will complete their inspection.

MPC provides a more efficient, secure in-person inspection process for the CBP Officer and the traveler, and shortens overall entry wait times.",Travel,Mobile Passport Control,Free

True to the original game, you can compete with up to four players for the most settlements, the longest roads and the largest army. You can trade with each other and claim the precious land with all its resources.

The game allows you to challenge other Catan fans online via cross-platform multiplayer to prove your strategy skills or play against the AI:
Various computer opponents, each with their own individual characteristics, will prove themselves worthy competitors: the pirate Jean, who knows no compromise, Vincent the merchant, who never allows himself to be cheated, Sean the knight, who takes what is rightfully his...

The popular Catan expansions ""Seafarers"", ""Cities and Knights"" and two new special scenarios are available as In-App purchases.

The complete Seafarers expansion includes more than 10 additional scenarios with an extensive campaign. Become Harbormaster, discover new islands and extra game elements like ships, gold fields, treasures and pirates. Ahoy!

The Cities and Knights expansion introduces various new gameplay mechanics that add even more variety to Catan. Invest new trade goods in city improvements to build one of the three metropolises of Catan – but beware of the barbarians attracted by Catan’s new wealth! You’ll need your best knights to fend them off! C&K contains a short campaign and 7 challenging maps.

Exciting adventures await you in the two new scenarios ""Enchanted Land"" and ""The Great Canal"". Vanquish dragons and bag their treasures or build a canal to help barren grain fields bloom once more.

Catan FAQ: 

Question: An expansion seems gone after an update or reinstallation of Catan or after restoring the device? 
Answer: Don’t worry! Your initial purchase is already saved in your iTunes account. You can restore your InApp purchases by selecting the restore-option in the Catan IAP menu. 

Question: I lost my campaign progress after reinstalling, updating or restoring my device. Is there any way to restore it? 
Answer: When saved games can’t be automatically restored, we’ve integrated a cheat code: In the campaign mode go to select player and enter „CatanWarp*“ (* = 1–15) as your player name and confirm. Exit the game via the home button and restart it. The campaign can now be continued from the specified level number (1–15). Levels up to the specified number will be unlocked in the custom game mode as well. 

Question: Are dice rolls really random? 
Answer: Of course! All dice rolls are 100% random and not modified in any way. We’re avid Catan players ourselves. We’ve played the iOS version hundreds of times while developing the program. There have been times when we won and lost a few games in a row because of the dice - just like when playing the board game!

Pro Altimeter uses the high-fidelity barometric pressure sensor in the Apple Watch to measure and compute altitude.  Although this is a Watch app, it has the same features, capabilities, and accuracy as the Pro Altimeter app for iPhone and iPad, just in a smaller form factor on your wrist!

Pro Altimeter has a dead simple interface.  Barometric altitude and GPS altitude are displayed in large easy to read numbers, with available units of feet or meters, and realtime accuracy estimates from the hardware.  At bottom are calibration and settings buttons. The display offers highly-readable color schemes of luminescent green on black, white on black, and midnight red on black.

Proper calibration is necessary to measure altitude from barometric pressure (this is why a pilot ""dials in"" the cockpit altimeter before taking off). Pro Altimeter offers numerous methods for calibration -- choose the easiest and most convenient:

1. Use GPS altitude.  This method correlates the measured local barometric pressure with the altitude measured by GPS. This method can be used when your device has a clear line of sight to the sky and a reliable GPS fix with good accuracy that you trust.

2. Manually enter altitude in feet or meters.  This method correlates the measured local barometric pressure with known altitude from landmarks, elevation benchmarks, trail markers, topo maps, land surveys, etc.

3. Manually enter pressure.  If you have a weather station, weather report, or METAR report with equivalent sea level pressure for a nearby location, this can be used to correlate local barometric pressure to altitude.  Pressure can be entered with units of inches Hg, kPa, or mb. 

4. Check local airports.  With the tap of a button, Pro Altimeter will locate the five closest airports within 100 miles (160km) of your present location anywhere in the world, and pull in METAR data.  From that list of five, pick the airport of your choice and Pro Altimeter will import pressure data for calibration.

Once calibrated, Pro Altimeter keeps track of the time since its last calibration.  Because weather and local barometric pressure change over time, the app will warn you when 6 hours have elapsed since the last calibration by flashing the ""CAL"" button.  You should calibrate as frequently as practical -- for example, on a hike, calibrate whenever you pass a trail marker or elevation benchmark, or hourly.  But at a minimum, calibrate at least every 6 hours or whenever weather changes in your area.

Pro Altimeter runs on all Apple Watch models running watchOS 8.3 or later.","Navigation,Utilities",Pro Altimeter for Watch,$0.99

With Taxfix, all this is possible.
Download the App now and take control of your financial wellbeing!
 
Whether you're an employee, trainee, student, pensioner, or expat, you can now take your taxes into your own hands!

// Step by step
Our app collects important info in a simple, conversational way – much like an interview. The intelligent question flow ensures that you only answer questions relevant to your case.

// No tax expertise required
You don't need tax knowledge to answer our questions. If you are unsure about something, the info boxes within the app offer assistance at any point.

// Simply photograph your documents
Upload photos of your annual payslip (Lohnsteuerbescheinigung) and a document to confirm your identity. To save you effort, we automatically transfer all relevant data from your annual payslip to the corresponding fields of your tax return.

// Risk-free calculation
Compared to the classic paper-form tax return, Taxfix's calculation offers a distinct advantage: It's completely risk-free! Have your refund calculated free of charge and then decide whether you would like us to submit your tax return to the tax office.

// Paperless transmission
Your tax return gets filed electronically, using the tax authorities' official ELSTER interface. Thanks to the paperless transmission to your local tax office, you don't need to print or sign anything. It’s a completely contactless transaction.

// Fast & efficient
Did you know that taxpayers in Germany can look forward to an average refund of €1,051? Or that you're able to file your tax returns retroactively for up to four years?

We created Taxfix to support as many taxpayers as possible in claiming their well-earned tax refunds. Our app always works to your advantage – any lump sums or deductions that apply are automatically considered!

Sim, é possível com o Basic-Français.

Basic-Français foi criado para ensinar o básico do francês em parceria com a Cidade de Paris e a Região da Ile de France, com co-financiamento europeu. 

Basic-Français é uma aplicação que acompanha os seus primeiros passos na aprendizagem do francês. Ludo e Vic, que foram concebidos para representar todos os povos deste mundo e para promover a igualdade de género, são convidados na sua vida quotidiana para o ajudar a descobrir a língua francesa com a ajuda de diálogos franceses adaptados à vida quotidiana e numerosas ilustrações para o ajudar a associar novas palavras em francês. 

Basic-Français remove a barreira da escrita ao declarar as instruções dos exercícios na sua língua materna. Na verdade, pode aprender o básico do francês independentemente do seu nível escolar. O francês básico pode ser usado mesmo por falantes não nativos e em línguas que não têm alfabeto.

Uma vez que as explicações são dadas numa língua que compreende, isto reduz consideravelmente o seu nível de stress e permite-lhe adquirir o conteúdo educacional mais rapidamente. Há também muitas actividades, incluindo o reconhecimento de voz, para melhorar a sua pronúncia, facilitar a compreensão e memorização e tornar a aprendizagem mais divertida!

Basic-Français abrange o primeiro nível (A1) do Quadro Europeu Comum de Referência para as Línguas, que lhe permite adquirir os meios de comunicação necessários para progredir rapidamente na sua aprendizagem do francês.

Our leading app allows you to use just your iPhone microphone to record and share your baby’s sounds. It is the best-in-class, has excellent reviews, is super simple and safe to use. Now supports Apple Airpods and Bluetooth Headphones.

""It took some time and patience... thank you for creating this cheap, awesome technology to use at home."" - Niki

Category #1 in the USA and 102 other countries. Here's why...

Developed by parents like you (with expertise in sound engineering and app development) who wanted a trustworthy, safe and easy-to-use way to record our baby's fetal sounds (kicks, heartbeat etc.) - and keep a record of a quality that we hadn't been able to find before in other apps. It has been extensively tested on expectant mothers.

""I was skeptical at first. Great app! Worth it."" - Legretta 

**** But honestly, does it actually work?? ****
Yes. We've sound-engineered ways to attempt to isolate the baby's heart beat, sounds (kicks, heart beat and more) and using an advanced algorithm, amplify them making them easier to detect and hear.

NOTE: It takes time, technique and patience and depends on the position and number of weeks of your baby so you'll need to stick with it. When you do, our results are excellent. Results are best between 27-40 weeks as your baby is bigger and stronger. 

We constantly improve our extensive tutorial and techniques to handhold you through - we even have a support group on Facebook so you can get help.

We want you to be happy with Hear My Baby heartbeat and getting results can sometimes be difficult.  If you are struggling (can't find your own heartbeat etc. DO contact us via support. We want to help you!

FAQs

**** No Accessories Required ****
We use the internal microphone from your phone to attempt to listen and record your fetal sound. We recommend Bluetooth Headphones for best results.

**** How It Works ****
1. Hear My Baby, has been precisely engineered to listen to abdominal sounds, then record and amplify them. Listen to your own heartbeat first to confirm the app is set up correctly. 
2. It works best when baby is head down and their back is facing forwards.
3. Remove the case, be in a very quiet room and focus on your lower abdomen. Listen then Tap record.
4. Our simple recording management helps you to keep a record of your special moment
5. Take a selfie if you wish and share 
6. We'll walk you through exactly how to get the best baby heartbeat results.

**** Easy Share Feature ****
Sharing is awesome you can opt to share via Facebook, Whats App, Instagram or email.

**** We Care About Your Privacy ****
We take your privacy and special moment seriously. You decide who sees or hears it and can delete it at any time.

**** Before you start... ****
You DO need to carefully follow the instructions for Hear My Baby to work. A quiet room is critical for results as the mic is super sensitive.   HMB doesn't fake the baby heartbeat or other fetal sounds :) 

Please Note: results are normally superb, however the recording may not work if your placenta is at the front of the tummy or the baby is in the wrong position.

**** Supported Phones ****
13,12, X, Xs, 11, 11 Pro, 8, 7, 7+, SE, 6s, 6s+, 6, 6+ 5c, 5s & 5. We don't support iPad.

**** Worried about safety? We are too! ***
HMB is safe but to be extra sure DO switch your iPhone to airplane mode. This is a precaution and automatically stops all cellular transmissions.

**** Is it a substitute for medical devices/support? ****
No - under no circumstances is HMB a substitute for medical support - if you don't get a result it doesn't mean anything is wrong :) Consult your doctor for any advice. We are NOT approved by the FDA. This is not a medical device and is not a medical baby heartbeat monitor. It is for FUN.

Please do check our T&Cs before downloading.

A device with at least 2 GB of RAM is required for this game to run properly.

Welcome to your new summer job at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, where kids and parents alike come for entertainment and food as far as the eye can see! The main attraction is Freddy Fazbear, of course; and his two friends. They are animatronic robots, programmed to please the crowds! The robots' behavior has become somewhat unpredictable at night however, and it was much cheaper to hire you as a security guard than to find a repairman.

From your small office you must watch the security cameras carefully. You have a very limited amount of electricity that you're allowed to use per night (corporate budget cuts, you know). That means when you run out of power for the night- no more security doors and no more lights! If something isn't right- namely if Freddybear or his friends aren't in their proper places, you must find them on the monitors and protect yourself if needed!

Can you survive five nights at Freddy's?

""For all the simplicity of the game’s controls and premise, Five Nights at Freddy‘s is frightening. It’s a fantastic example of how cleverness in design and subtlety can be used to make an experience terrifying. Simple still images and proper character design steal the show in this game, and show that Scott Cawthon knows quite a lot about the secret fears people feel when looking at creepy dolls and toys. It’s elegant in how it sows fear, and is a must-own for anyone who likes scary games."" -Joel Couture IndieGameMag.com

HOW IT WORKS
Most aircraft today are equipped with ADS-B transponders that transmit positional data. Flightradar24 has a rapidly growing network of 20,000 ground stations to receive this data that then shows up as aircraft moving on a map in the app. In an expanding number of regions, with the help of multilateration, we’re able to calculate the positions of aircraft that don’t have ADS-B transponders. Coverage is subject to change at any time.

Join Alto and his friends and set off on an endless sandboarding journey to discover its secrets.

Soar above windswept dunes, traverse thrilling canyons, and explore long-hidden temples in a fantastical place far from home.

Along the way, you’ll grind across vines, bounce atop hot air balloons, ride towering rock walls, and escape mischievous lemurs – all while uncovering the desert’s many mysteries. 

Features:

• A standalone experience. Alto’s Odyssey is the follow-up to the critically acclaimed Alto’s Adventure, but you don’t need to have played one to enjoy the other.

• Easy to learn, difficult to master. At the heart of the Alto series is an elegant one-touch trick system. Chain together combos, and complete 180 goals —  all with intuitive controls.

• Explore Biomes. From the dunes, to the canyons, to the temples, explore a rich and diverse landscape, with each area boasting unique visuals and gameplay.  

• Newfound heights. Discover secrets in the sky with hot-air balloons, moving grind rails, and wall riding.

• Master the elements. In addition to dynamic lighting and weather effects like sandstorms and shooting stars, the desert is home to swirling wind vortexes and rushing water.

• Meet Alto and friends. Unlock six unique characters, each with their own attributes and abilities.

• Zen Mode. Complete with its own serene soundtrack, this relaxing mode distills Odyssey down to its purest elements: no scores, no coins, and no power-ups. Just you and the endless desert. 

• Photo Mode. From the pause screen, get behind the lens and take stunning photos of your trip through the desert. Pinch, swipe, pan and zoom to frame the ideal shot, and share them with friends and family.

• Original music and handcrafted audio. Headphones recommended!

• Universal app with iCloud support. Play on your iPhone, iPad, and Apple TV, and your progress will always be in sync.

Alto’s Odyssey is a premium game with no ads or in-app purchases. Purchase once, play forever.","Games,Action,Sports",Alto's Odyssey,$4.99

Appen FonoMix 1 - utgår från läsinlärning enligt FonoMix Munmetoden som har stark vetenskaplig förankring i aktuell forskning om språkutveckling och läsning och som ingått i studier, som visat mycket positivta resultat. Metoden gavs ut första gången 2006. Appen tränar på ett enkelt och lättbegripligt sätt ljuden/munnarna o s l a r m (6 ljud). Appen visar att ord är uppbyggda av ”bygg-stenar”/ljud och ger barnet/eleven säkerhet i att både göra ord (”skriva”) och ”läsa” ord med hjälp av ljuden/munnarna (totalt 15 ord).  

Målgrupp: 4-5-årigar i förskolan eller i hemmet och elever i alla åldrar som har behov av ljudträning och den allra första grunden i läs- inlärningen (elever i spec-, tal-, sva- eller vuxenundervisning).  

Appen FonoMix 1  
• är underhållande och rolig tack vare att många sinnen aktiveras 
• har ett strukturerat och multisensoriskt arbetssätt 
• omfattar endast 6 ljud (o s l a r m) för att alla ska lyckas automatisera dessa ljud och snabbt knäcka läskoden 
• visar språkljuden (fonemen) som bilder på munnar, vilka gör ljuden synliga och därmed lättare att uppfatta, minnas och själv producera 
• befäster ljuden i minnet genom namn som talar om hur ljudet görs i munnen, t ex Tandväsaren (s) och dessa används parallellt med ljudet 
• fungerar fristående men det är stora fördelar om eleven också kan laborera med FonoMix konkreta förskole-sats ”Leka med Pratljud” 
• är lämplig för elever med annan språkbakgrund än svenska (Sva, Sfi) som ska börja att lära sig läsa på svenska

As the official security force for the airport, you're the only thing standing between the airport terminal and complete chaos. 

Watch out for people flying with a fake passport, or concealed weapons. The X-ray machine reveals the contraband passengers are trying to smuggle into your city. While their bags are in transit, scan them for anything that might be hidden, you never know what’s inside.

Armed with your trusty flashlight, you alone must police the airport. As every pilot makes their way to a jet preparing for takeoff, criminals are preparing their escape. Be watchful, be vigilant, and let only the most honest travellers pass.

You must anticipate the movement of the cards, and use your dynamic vision to find the right combination of patterns within the time limit.
If you make a mistake, you will lose half of your hearts, but you can recover them by using the items that appear from time to time.
If you take items from the clock, the time limit will be added and you can play longer.
Find all the pairs of cards quickly.

The WW PersonalPoints™ Program is our first-ever weight-loss plan built 100% for you and your goals.

Using the very latest nutrition and behavior change science, rigorous testing, and in-depth feedback from our members, we’ve advanced our award-winning algorithm, which boils down the most important, complex nutritional data—including calories, protein, fiber, unsaturated fats vs. saturated fats, natural vs. added sugar—into a single number: the PersonalPoints value.

Your personalized weight-loss plan will guide you toward a nutritious pattern of eating and help you understand patterns to create healthy habits. With WW, everything is on the menu: No food is off-limits! Our new program even allows you to add Points®—a WW first —for doing healthy things like eating non-starchy vegetables, drinking water, and being active.

As our most personalized and flexible program for sustainable weight management, WW / WeightWatchers has the tools you need. Unlike other weight-loss programs that only count calories, we know that real success happens when you look at losing weight holistically, from nutrition and movement to mindset and sleep. WW is weight loss that works and wellness that works, so download the WW app now and get a free trial today!  After your free trial, plans auto-renew monthly unless you cancel before trial ends.


HOW IT WORKS
WW’s team of nutrition and behavioral scientists constantly iterate and assess the most advanced research to power our program. 

Food: Learn to incorporate healthier choices into your diet while still losing weight, thanks to your PersonalPoints Budget and ZeroPoint™ foods (which you don’t need to track). Check out our “What’s in Your Fridge?” tool for personalized recipe recommendations based on what you’ve got in the house.

Activity: The activity tracker helps you make progress toward your goals. We'll show you how to sync your fitness device (including Apple Health) and grow your Points Budget by incorporating more activity into your day. Also, enjoy hundreds of on-demand, equipment-free workouts.

App features:
weekly check-in
progress reports
weight loss tracker
sleep tracker
water tracker
activity tracker
meal tracker
barcode scanner
11,000+ recipes
blood sugar tracker

Sleep: Science shows people who get consistently less shut-eye are hungrier throughout the day. Track sleep, relax with Breethe meditations, plus get science-backed strategies from our behavioral psychologists.

Mindset: For health and wellness, what’s on your mind is just as important as what’s on your plate. Our team of behavioral psychologists deliver 5-Minute Coaching audios to help you refocus and tackle roadblocks like stress eating.

Support: With 24/7 Live Coaching, an expert WW Coach is available via chat to answer questions or provide a dose of weight-loss motivation. Plus, we have an exclusive social network to connect with like-minded WW members!

You also have additional account management options for your Microsoft personal, work or school accounts.

Getting started with multi-factor authentication

Multi factor authentication (MFA)provides a second layer of security. When enabled, during login after entering your password, you’ll be asked for an additional way to prove it’s really you. Either approve the notification sent to the Microsoft Authenticator, or enter the one-time password (OTP) generated by the app. The OTP codes have a 30 second timer counting down. This timer is so you never have to use the same time-based one-time password (TOTP) twice and you don’t have to remember the number. The OTP doesn’t require you to be connected to a network, and it won’t drain your battery. You can add multiple accounts to your app, including non-Microsoft accounts like Facebook, Amazon, Dropbox, Google, LinkedIn, GitHub, and more.

Getting started with passwordless

Use your phone, not your password, to log into your Microsoft account. Just enter your username, then approve the notification sent to your phone. Your fingerprint, face ID, or PIN will provide a second layer of security in this two-step verification process. After you’ve signed in with two factor authentication (2FA), you’ll have access to all your Microsoft products and services, such as Outlook, OneDrive, Office, and more.

Getting started with autofill

Microsoft Authenticator app can also autofill passwords for you. Sign-in on the Passwords tab inside the Authenticator app with your personal Microsoft account to start syncing passwords, including the passwords saved in Microsoft Edge. Make Microsoft Authenticator the default autofill provider and start autofilling passwords on apps and sites you visit on your mobile. Your passwords are protected with multi-factor authentication in the app. You will need to prove yourself with your fingerprint, face ID, or PIN to access and autofill passwords on your mobile. You can also import passwords from Google Chrome and other password managers.

Microsoft personal, work or school accounts

Sometimes your work or school might ask you to install the Microsoft Authenticator when accessing certain organization resources. You will need to register your device to your organization through the app and add your work or school account. Microsoft Authenticator supports cert-based authentication by issuing a certificate on your device. This will let your organization know that the sign-in request is coming from a trusted device and help you seamlessly and securely access additional Microsoft apps and services without needing to log into each.

Access Permissions
Microsoft Authenticator includes the following optional access permissions. All these require user consent. If you choose to not grant these optional access permissions, you can still use Microsoft Authenticator for other services that do not require such permission. For more information see https://aka.ms/authappfaq

Accessibility Service. Used to optionally support Autofill on more apps and sites.
Location. Sometimes your organization wants to know your location before allowing you to access certain resources. The app will request this permission only if your organization has a policy requiring location.
Camera. Used to scan QR codes when you add a work, school, or non-Microsoft account.
Read the contents of your storage. This permission is only used when you report a technical problem through the app settings. Some information from your storage is collected to diagnose the issue.","Productivity,Utilities",Microsoft Authenticator,Free

Meet cute characters, steal their trash, and throw them in a hole.

WHERE TRASH IS TREASURE
Raccoons have taken over Donut County with remote-controlled trash-stealing holes. You play as BK, a hole-driving raccoon who swallows up his friends and their homes to earn idiotic prizes. 

When BK falls into one of his own holes, he’s confronted by his best friend Mira and the residents of Donut County, who are all stuck 999 feet underground… and they demand answers!

THE HOLE KEEPS GROWING
• EXPLORE every character’s home, each with their own unique environment.
• MOVE the hole to swallow up their stuff, growing bigger each time.
• COMBINE objects inside for crazy effects: cook soup, breed bunnies, launch fireworks, and more.
• CATAPULT things back out of the hole. You can use it to solve puzzles...or just destroy stuff.
• DEVOUR everything. The hole won’t stop until the whole county is all gone.
 
Donut County was created by Ben Esposito, designer on What Remains of Edith Finch and The Unfinished Swan. It is the result of six years of solo development, dozens of donuts (for research), and one fateful encounter with a raccoon.","Games,Puzzle,Adventure",Donut County,$4.99

It makes browsing the web at night so much better. With Noir, you won’t be blinded by bright websites ever again.

And the results look great too. Noir generates a custom dark style for each website you visit, based on the colors that are used on a page. You won’t even notice this happening in the background – that’s how fast it is – but you’ll certainly appreciate the end result: a beautiful dark mode tailored for each website, where contrast is preserved and highlights still pop. And with over 20 built-in themes and the ability to create your own, you can customize the results exactly the way you want.

Noir works with any website you visit in Safari, automatically. By default, Noir is linked to your device’s Dark Mode, so websites will only go dark when you want them to. But you can easily customize this to your liking, even per website. Only want to use Noir on just a few specific websites? Sure thing! Disable Noir on some websites? No problem!

Built from the ground up for iOS 15 and iPadOS 15, the app feels right at home on your device. It supports the brand new Safari web extension feature, which means there’s no need to manually activate it every time you load a new page. The app also tightly integrates with system features such as Focus Filters and Shortcuts to fully integrate Noir in all your workflows. And your settings are automatically synced to all your devices using iCloud.

And just as importantly, Noir takes your privacy seriously: it doesn’t collect any of your browsing data. Period.

Noir is made by a solo iOS developer. It does not include any subscriptions or ads. Buy Noir once, use it forever.

Notes:
• Found a website where Noir’s dark mode doesn’t look just right? Let me know by reporting it. The app will be frequently updated to address issues that are reported.

Privacy Policy:
• The Noir extension requires access to the websites you visit to analyze the existing style of the page and to override it with Noir's dark style.
• Noir never collects your browsing data. The only data Noir ‘collects’ are your settings, and those will never leave your device.
• You can read Noir’s full Privacy Policy at https://getnoir.app/privacypolicy","Utilities,Productivity",Noir - Dark Mode for Safari,$2.99

Set hundreds of years in the future on the distant planet of Aida, the shared open-world MMORPG, anime-infused sci-fi adventure Tower of Fantasy from developer Hotta Studio and publisher Level Infinite, is now available on PC and mobile platforms globally. Players will be able to experience an anime-inspired post-apocalyptic sci-fi art style, freeform character development, and exciting combat through thrilling battles and exciting open-world exploration.

In Tower of Fantasy, dwindling resources and a lack of energy have forced mankind to leave earth and migrate to Aida, a lush and habitable alien world. There, they observed the comet Mara and discovered an unknown but powerful energy called ""Omnium"" contained in it. They built the Omnium Tower to capture Mara, but due to the influence of Omnium radiation, a catastrophic disaster occurred on their new homeworld.

Bridge is a card game played with four people who play as two competing teams of two players called ""pairs"" (North-South and East-West). The players of the same team sit across from each other at a card table. Bridge consists of two parts: the auction, which determines the contract to fulfil, and the play, where the side that wins the bidding tries to take the tricks necessary to make their contract.
 
On Funbridge, you play South while North, East and West are played by the same artificial intelligence (AI) at all tables. So no need to wait until other players are available to play. The AI is available 24/7!

Other players play the same deals as you. The aim is to achieve the best result. You enter rankings allowing you to compare your play to other players.

Funbridge is designed for any type of players: from beginners (introductory module, lessons, exercises) to experts (tournaments). It also suits any player who wants to start playing bridge again (practice, challenges against friends).

Game modes:
- Get started with bridge: (re)discover the basics of bridge.
- Series tournaments: perfect to see how you compare with players of your level.
- Tournaments of the day: compare yourself to players from all around the world.
- Practice deals: play deals at your own pace without stress.
- Face the elites: pit yourself against top players from the Elite series.
- Challenges: challenge any player in head-to-head tournaments.
- Two-player game: practise with your favourite partner.
- Team Championship: create your team and compete against teams from all over the world.
- Federation tournaments: improve your federation ranking thanks to official tournaments held conjointly with bridge federations.
- Funbridge Points tournaments: play these tournaments to enter the Funbridge Points rankings and compare yourself to all players.
- Exclusive tournaments: create your own tournaments and discuss the deals you play.
- Commented tournaments: get valuable advice from a bridge champion.

You can also:
- Pause your deal or tournament
- Watch a replay of other players' moves
- Replay deals that you have already played
- Get the meaning of the bids made at the table
- Seek advice from the AI in case of doubt
- Set your bidding and card play conventions
- Access an analysis of your play once the deal is over
- Meet your friends and chat with them

Internet connection required: the AI is not in the app, which is therefore much more efficient and we can continuously improve it without you having to update it.

Catan FAQ: 

Question: An expansion seems gone after an update or reinstallation of Catan or after restoring the device? 
Answer: Don’t worry, your initial purchase is already saved in your iTunes account. You can restore your InApp purchases by selecting the restore-option in the Catan IAP menu. 

Question: I lost my campaign progress after reinstalling, updating or restoring my device. Is there any way to restore it? 
Answer: When saved games can’t be automatically restored, we’ve integrated a cheat code: In the campaign mode go to select player and enter ""CatanWarp*"" (* = 1–15) as your player name and confirm. Exit the game via the home button and restart it. The campaign can now be continued from the specified level number (1–15). Levels up to the specified number will be unlocked in the custom game mode as well. 

Question: Are dice rolls really random? 
Answer: Of course! All dice rolls are 100% random and not modified in any way. We’re avid Catan players ourselves. We’ve played the iOS version hundreds of times while developing the program. There have been times when we won and lost a few games in a row because of the dice - just like when playing the board game!

• Staus. Informiere dich vorab über Staus auf deiner Route, um eventuell eine alternative Route zu starten.  

• Einsatzfahrzeuge wie Krankenwagen und Feuerwehr. Ganz ohne Hektik machst du rechtzeitig Platz, sodass der Rettungsdienst schneller sein Ziel erreicht.   

• Unfälle, Baustellen, stillstehende Fahrzeuge und andere Gefahrensituationen. So kannst du sicher und vorausschauend handeln. 

• Wechselverkehrszeichen. Dir entgeht nie wieder eine gesperrte oder zusätzlich geöffnete Fahrbahn, oder die zulässige Höchstgeschwindigkeit. 

• Navigieren. Korrekte Anweisungen von A nach B unter Berücksichtigung der aktuellen Verkehrssituation oder ein alternativer Routenvorschlag, wenn auf deiner Route Hindernisse zu erwarten sind.  

• Kostenpflichtiges Parken. Mit nur einem Knopfdruck startest du bei deiner Ankunft am Zielort eine Parkaktion. Die App erkennt, ob du in einer gebührenpflichtigen Parkzone stehst, sodass du nicht vergisst, die Parkaktion zu aktivieren. Sobald du wieder losfährst, schicken wir dir eine Benachrichtigung zum Beenden der Parkaktion. Auf diese Weise bezahlst du nie zu viel.   

• Ampeln. Für einige Ampeln in den Niederlanden wird der aktuelle Stand angezeigt. In Zukunft werden weitere Ampeln registriert werden, wirst du die Zeit sehen können, bis die Ampel auf Grün springt und eine Geschwindigkeitsempfehlung bekommen, um weiter auf der grünen Welle fahren zu können.

Das alphabetische Glossar unterstützt Sie bei der Vertiefung Ihres Wissens.

Entscheiden Sie sich bei der Auswahl der Fragen entweder für die kurzen Testaufgaben zum Wissenscheck oder für die längeren Aufgaben, die in Analogie zu den Prüfungsaufgaben mit einer Ausgangssituation und der Angabe der Anzahl der richtigen Lösungen beginnen. Bitte beachten Sie, dass es sich bei diesen Fragen nicht um Originalprüfungsaufgaben handelt. Diese unterliegen der Geheimhaltung.

Wählen Sie zwischen dem Trainings- oder Testmodus: Im Trainingsmodus werden Ihnen nach dem Lernkartenprinzip nur die richtigen Antworten angeboten. Im Testmodus erhalten Sie direkt nach Ihrem Lösungsversuch eine Auswertung mit Anzeige der richtigen und falschen Antworten. Am Ende des Tests werden Sie gefragt, ob Sie die falsch beantworteten Fragen noch einmal wiederholen möchten. 

Mehr als 600 Aufgaben sind entsprechend der Ausbilder-Eignungsverordnung (AEVO) in vier Handlungsfelder unterteilt. 

• Ausbildungsvoraussetzungen prüfen und Ausbildung planen, 
• Ausbildung vorbereiten und bei der Einstellung von Auszubildenden mitwirken, 
• Ausbildung durchführen, 
• Ausbildung abschließen

Die Aufgaben bilden nicht die Strukturierung der Prüfung ab, die Sie auf der Website der DIHK-Bildungs-gGmbh einsehen können. Der Fokus der Aufgaben in der App liegt darauf, die Inhalte des Rahmenplans möglichst umfassend abzubilden, damit Sie Sicherheit im Umgang mit den Handlungsfeldern gewinnen.

Den Aufgaben in der App sind seit Anfang 2022 Ordnungsnummern vorangestellt, damit Sie Aufgaben besser identifizieren können, wenn Sie sich Notizen machen, sich mit Ihrem Dozenten oder Ihren Mitlernenden austauschen oder den Support kontaktieren möchten.

Das Wichtigste in Kürze:
• Erweitern Sie Ihr Wissen: Im Trainingsbereich werden Ihnen wie bei Lernkarten zu jeder Aufgabe nur die korrekten Antworten angezeigt.
• Testen Sie Ihr Wissen: Im Testbereich erwarten Sie kompakte Aufgaben und ausführlichere Aufgaben mit Ausgangssituation. 
• Die richtige Lösung können Sie auf einen Blick mit Ihrem eigenen Lösungsversuch zur Feststellung des aktuellen Wissensstands vergleichen.
• Lernen Sie gezielt durch die Auswahl der Handlungsfelder. Oder stellen Sie die Fragen handlungsfeldübergreifend zusammen.
• Vertiefen Sie Ihr Wissen mithilfe der 400 Glossareinträge zu allen wichtigen Begriffen rund um die AEVO.

„Alles Einstellungssache“: 
Wie Sie lernen möchten, können Sie über „Einstellungen“ selbst entscheiden. Im Testbereich können Sie zwischen dem Power- oder Reihenfolgemodus wählen.

1. Powermodus:

In diesem voreingestellten Modus werden Ihnen die Aufgaben zum nachhaltigen Lernen in bestimmten Abständen erneut vorgelegt. Die falsch beantworteten häufiger als die richtig gelösten. Die Aufgaben werden so lange wiederholt, bis alle richtig beantwortet wurden. In welchen Abständen Ihnen eine Aufgabe vorgelegt wird und wie viele Fragen per Lernsession angeboten werden, können Sie selbst einstellen. Der Powermodus ist beim Erststart der App voreingestellt, kann aber jeder Zeit in den Reihenfolgemodus geändert werden.


2. Reihenfolgemodus:

Hier besteht die Möglichkeit, die Aufgaben gezielt unter Testbedingungen zu bearbeiten. Sie können sich die Aufgaben entweder in vorgegebener oder zufälliger Reihenfolge vorgelegen lassen.

Um Lerninhalte und Ihre Ergebnisse auf allen Ihren mobilen Endgeräten auf dem gleichen Stand zu haben, können Sie diese synchronisieren, indem Sie sich ein Benutzerkonto einrichten.","Bildung,Wirtschaft",IHK.AEVO–Trainieren und Testen,"7,99 €"

2 new scenes added. Drive the street sweeper and unload the truck crane!

On our construction site your child can drive a digger, mix cement, roof a building, operate a crane, drive a street sweeper or paint a house. There’s so much to do here. Our Little Builders dig, plaster, fill, paint and mix... And they need your children´s help.

At the same time they can watch funny things happen, because on every building site there’s always something going wrong. Water suddenly bursts from a pipe, a builder falls into a hole or the wind blows the bricks away because the cement wasn’t dry yet.

Little Builders is the first 3D app for children aged 2-6 years that want to explore the world of being a real little builder. Depending on the child’s age, all animations and functions can run automatically or be controlled through a tap.

7 interactive scenarios contain over 100 interactive animations and surprises:

1. Steer the digger, fill the truck and repair the water pipe.
2. Paint the house in different colours and unload the removals truck.
3. Operate the crane and build a new roof for the house.
4. Mix cement and build a real wall.
5. Operate a big cement mixer and concrete a large area.
6. Drive the street sweeper and clean the dirty road.
7. Unload the crane truck and make sure it leaves on time.

Amazing graphics, great animations, a user-friendly interface, no text and no in-app purchases. Download now and start building!

Met name bij type 1 diabetes bestaat de behandeling steeds meer uit een combinatie van kennis en technologie. Goed en succesvol gebruik van bijvoorbeeld een insulinepomp vereist ook goede kennis van koolhydraten.      

De 'Koolhydraatkenner' is een uitkomst omdat daarmee die kennis snel en goed kan worden opgezocht. 

Goede koolhydraatkennis wordt nog belangrijker omdat er tegenwoordig insulinepompen zijn, die gekoppeld kunnen worden aan een glucosemeter, die continue de suikerwaarde meet.  

De koolhydraatkenner is een tool waarmee je de koolhydratentabel op je mobiele telefoon altijd bij je hebt. 
De koolhydraatkenner, die al bestaat sinds 2008 en al  duizenden keren is gedownload, is beschikbaar voor iPhone en iPod Touch. 

BELANGRIJK: de Koolhydraatkenner is ontwikkeld in samenwerking met de artsen en dietisten van Diabeter, het nationaal kenniscentrum voor Diabetes.

De koolhydraatkenner geeft voor meer dan 1000 producten de hoeveelheid koolhydraten (gram) per hoeveelheid. De eenheid waarin deze hoeveelheid is gegeven verschilt per product. Zo bevat een glas appelsap 12 gram koolhydraten. Eén stuk baklava (van 30 gram) bevat 16 gram koolhydraten. Deze waardes zijn geverifieerd door erkende artsen en dietisten. Het zoeken in de lijst met producten wordt sterk vereenvoudigd door een goede zoekfunctie.

Producten kunnen worden gebundeld tot een zogenaamd eetmoment(bolus). Per eetmoment wordt de hoeveelheid koolhydraten geteld. Een dag kan uit meerdere eetmomenten bestaan. De hoeveelheid ingenomen koolhydraten wordt daarnaast ook voor een hele dag berekend. 

Verder kunt u op eenvoudige wijze de uitgebreide lijst producten verder uitbreiden met 'eigen' producten. Deze 'eigen' producten worden in de standaard lijst opgenomen. Alle beschikbare functies zijn ook op deze producten van toepassing.

Tevens beschikt de Koolhydraatkenner over een aantal handige vuistregels waarmee heel snel de hoeveelheid koolhydraten uitgerekend kan worden van een apart lijstje met producten.","Medical,Lifestyle",Koolhydraatkenner,$1.99

Ever dreamed of running your own hotel? Start from the ground up in this fun and fast-paced time-management game where the aim is to build an accommodation empire and demonstrate your dedication to hospitality. Show your skills as a hotel manager, invest wisely in staff and property improvements, and work your socks off to become a hospitality tycoon in this addictive and entertaining casual simulator.

► FIRST-CLASS SERVICE

• Climb to the top: Start the game as a simple bellhop single-handedly cleaning rooms, greeting guests at reception, collecting payments and tips, and keeping the bathroom stocked with toilet paper. As your bank balance expands, upgrade rooms and facilities, and employ new staff to help keep up with the growing demand at your hotel. Your guests may be sleeping comfortably, but there’s no time to rest for a determined hotel tycoon.

• Build an empire: There are several hotels to explore and expand, each with dozens of different unique upgrades to make before you reach five-star perfection. Demonstrate your competence as a manager in each location, then get promoted to get a new and bigger property, and continue your path to becoming a true hotel tycoon. Each hotel has its own style and atmosphere too.

• Keep going: If you want success in this high-stakes industry, you can’t just stroll around your property at a leisurely pace. Upgrade your and your employees’ movement speed to work faster and provide your guests with all the services they need ASAP — it’ll boost your revenue too.

• Amenities are the answer: Maximise profits and get more funds to invest in this fun simulator by ensuring your hotels have all available amenities. Bathrooms are the first step, but work hard and you’ll soon have the opportunity to add vending machines, restaurants, parking lots, and swimming pools to your properties. Guests will pay extra for each facility, boosting your revenue. Though remember each facility also needs staffing, so get hiring or you’ll soon run off your feet with angry guests left standing in line for each amenity.

• Grand designs: Upgrade accommodation to improve guests’ experience of your property and choose from a range of different room designs in each location. In this engaging simulator, you’re not just a manager, you’re an interior designer too!

► FIVE-STAR FUN

Looking for a time-management game that’s original and simple to play and provides endless hours of entertainment? Dive straight into the fast-paced world of hospitality provision and develop your skills as a manager, investor, and designer.

YouTube Kids was created to give kids a more contained environment filled with family-friendly videos on all different topics, igniting your kids’ inner creativity and playfulness. Parents and caregivers can guide the journey as your kids discover new and exciting interests along the way. Learn more at youtube.com/kids

A safer online experience for kids
We work hard to keep the videos on YouTube Kids family-friendly and use a mix of automated filters built by our engineering teams, human review, and feedback from parents to protect our youngest users online.  But no system is perfect and inappropriate videos can slip through, so we’re constantly working to improve our safeguards and offer more features to help parents create the right experience for their families.

Customize your child’s experience with Parental Controls
Limit screen time: Set a time limit for how long your kids can watch and help encourage their transition from watching to doing.
Keep up with what they watch: Simply check the watch it again page and you’ll always know what they’ve watched and the newest interests they’re exploring.
Blocking: Don’t like a video? Block the video or whole channel, and never see it again.
Flagging: You can always alert us to inappropriate content by flagging a video for review. Flagged videos are reviewed 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

Create individual experiences as unique as your kids
Create up to eight kid profiles, each with their own viewing preferences, video recommendations, and settings. Choose from “Approved Content Only” mode or select an age category that fits your child, “Preschool”, “Younger”, or “Older”.

Select the “Approved Content Only” mode if you want to handpick the videos, channels and/or collections that you’ve approved your child to watch. In this mode, kids won’t be able to search for videos. The “Preschool” Mode designed for kids 4 and under curates videos that promote creativity, playfulness, learning, and exploration. The “Younger” Mode allows kids 5-8 to explore their interests in a wide variety of topics including songs, cartoons, and crafts. While our “Older” Mode gives kids 9 and up the chance to search and explore additional content such as popular music and gaming videos for kids.

All kinds of videos for all kinds of kids
Our library is filled with family-friendly videos on all different topics, igniting your kids’ inner creativity and playfulness. It’s everything from their favorite shows and music to learning how to build a model volcano (or make slime ;-), and everything in between.

Typewriter. Ring-binder. Scrapbook. Scrivener combines all the writing tools you need to craft your first draft, from nascent notion to final full stop.

Tailor-made for creating long manuscripts, Scrivener banishes page fright by allowing you to compose your text in any order, in sections as large or small as you like. Got a great idea but don’t know where it fits? Write when inspiration strikes and find its place later. Grow your manuscript organically, idea by idea.

Whether you plan or plunge, Scrivener works your way: meticulously outline every last detail first, or hammer out a complete draft and restructure later. Or do a bit of both. All text sections in Scrivener are fully integrated with its outlining tools, so working with an overview of your manuscript is only ever a tap away, and turning Chapter Four into Chapter One is as simple as drag and drop.

Need to refer to research? In Scrivener, your background material is always at hand. Write a description based on a photograph. Reference a video or PDF. Check for consistency with an earlier chapter. On the iPad, open two documents side-by-side; on the iPhone, flip between research and writing with just two taps.

Once you’re ready to share your work with the world, simply compile everything into a single document for printing, or export to popular formats such as Word, PDF, Final Draft or plain text. You can even share using different formatting, so that you can write in your favorite font and still keep your editor happy.

Whether you’re looking for bread-and-butter delay sounds, subtle enhancements, or evolving experimental echoes, TTAP fits what you need.

*** Please note: TTAP is an Audio Unit extension (AUv3) – it only works in an AUv3 host app like Garageband, AUM, Cubasis, Modstep, Beatmaker 3, etc... ***

HOW IT WORKS / DESCRIPTION

TTAP is a delay with two buffers. Each buffer features extensive controls for shaping the envelope of the delay sound, with another control set for glitchy pre-feedback repeats and warm pitch-bends.
Inspired by both the classic sounds of tape delays and by experiments in editing and splicing tape, TTAP features a dedicated Section control for determining the maximum length of time of the second buffer. Section also acts as a virtual LFO control, affecting a number of modulation parameters.
Both the Delay Time and Section controls in TTAP can either be synced to your DAW, or run free, providing up to 3.0 seconds of time for each. Try changing the speed while TTAP is running with high feedback for the expanding/contracting doppler sound familiar to any dub lover (or automate and randomize the process using the Bend control).

— 

In The Fade
Fade easily between two delay buffers, or jump to using one buffer exclusively with the click of a button.

Glitch and Chance
In addition to the familiar feedback control, TTAP includes controls for randomized Repeats (synced to the Section time) for a glitchier sound. In addition, each of the buffers features a dedicated Reverse switch.

Intuitive Display
In addition to control positions, the animations in TTAP give you essential information such as the mix between buffers, amount of feedback, time gap between buffers, and the envelope for each buffer.

Go By Feel
As part of encouraging more musical and creative applications of WOV, in addition to using symbols for controls, the controls in WOV do not have individual readouts. We encourage you to let your ears determine the right knob positions whenever you can! If you’d like a precise readout, however, you can see/edit it by clicking on any parameter and looking in the upper-right corner of WOV.

By default, all labels are graphical – for text labels, click the symbols/text label switch in the lower-right had corner.",Music,TTAP : delay gone deep,$2.99

Dabei werden Wahrnehmung und Wortauffassung sowie sinnverstehendes und informationsentnehmendes Lesen geübt. Das Kind lernt Wörter schneller zu erfassen, sodass seine Leseflüssigkeit und Lesegeschwindigkeit zunehmen.
Die liebevoll gestalteten und temporeichen Übungen bieten zusätzlich viel Aktion und Spielspaß so dass Lesetraining ganz nebenbei erfolgt! Durch das Spielen gegen die Zeit werden die Kinder zum Verbessern ihres Highscores und damit zum häufigen Wiederholen motiviert. Unterschiedliche Geschwindigkeiten und Schwierigkeitsstufen ermöglichen, dass jedes Kind entsprechend seiner Lesefähigkeit starten kann.

Die 8 Lesespiele fördern zentrale Lesefertigkeiten:

Punkte jagen 
Mit den Augen wird ein schnell wandernder Punkt verfolgt, in dem ab und zu ein anderer Buchstabe oder ein anderes Wort erscheint. Diese Übung trainiert die Konzentrationsfähigkeit sowie eine gleichmäßige und schnelle Augenbewegung. Gleichzeitig werden die reflexhafte Reaktion und Blicksprünge geübt. Denn bei einem flüssigen und schnellen Lesen bewegen sich die Augen nicht gleichmäßig von Buchstabe zu Buchstabe, sondern sie springen von einem Haltepunkt zum nächsten. 

Geisterwörter
Es wird ein Wort gezeigt, welches nach kurzer Zeit wieder verschwindet. Dieses Wort soll aus einer Auswahl von vier Wörtern wiedererkannt werden.
Diese Übung trainiert das ganzheitliche Erfassen und das Wiedererkennen der Wortgestalt von bis zu viersilbigen Wörtern. Dadurch kann das Kind Wörter schneller erfassen, sodass seine Leseflüssigkeit zunimmt. 

Wortpaare
Aus einer Anzahl von Wortpaaren sollen die ungleichen Wortpaare erkannt und angetippt werden. 
Diese Übung trainiert die Lesegeschwindigkeit bekannter und unbekannter Wörter. Die Wörter werden als Bilder wahrgenommen und werden nicht Buchstabe für Buchstabe mühsam erlesen. 

Wortgitter
In einem Buchstabenfeld soll möglichst schnell das gesuchte Wort zweimal wiedergefunden werden.
Die Wörter sind je nach Level horizontal und vertikal oder auch diagonal und übereck versteckt.
Diese Übung trainiert die Wortauffassung und die Diskrimination von Wortbildern. 

Bücherwurm
In einem Kontinuum von sich bewegenden Buchstaben sollen möglichst schnell die gesuchten Wörter und Sätze erlesen werden. Diese Übung trainiert die Erfassung von Wörtern und Wortgrenzen. 

Bildersuche 
In einem Bild sollen möglichst schnell die beschriebenen Situationen gefunden und angetippt werden. Diese Übung trainiert sinnverstehendes und informationsentnehmendes Lesen sowie die Fähigkeiten, Informationen (aus Text und Bild) in Beziehung zueinander zu setzen, Schlussfolgerungen zu ziehen und Wichtiges von Unwichtigem zu unterscheiden.

Seifenblasen
Diese Übung trainiert die Blickspanne, die Konzentration und die Wortauffassung. Das Auge der Kinder muss über das gesamte Spielfeld wandern, da die Auswahlmöglichkeiten über das ganze Spielfeld verteilt sind und sich beständig bewegen. Durch den konzentrierten Blick und das Lesen muss in kurzer Zeit wahrgenommen werden, ob das verwürfelte Wort im Ballon die gleichen Buchstaben enthält wie das Suchwort. Die Lesefertigkeiten und -fähigkeiten werden dadurch weiter gefestigt und gefördert.

Leserätsel
In sogenannten Logicals nehmen die Kinder nach genauer Lektüre der Hinweise Zuordnungen von z.B. Berufen, Eigenschaften und Lieblingsfarben zu Personen vor.
Diese Übung trainiert sinnverstehendes und informationsentnehmendes Lesen sowie die Fähigkeiten, Informationen (aus mehreren Texten) in Beziehung zu einander zu setzen, Schlussfolgerungen zu ziehen und Wichtiges von Unwichtigem zu unterscheiden.

""I could describe the value of the experience in terms of early music education. I could describe the meticulous design of the app, even down to the music when the credits are rolling. I could continue to wax eloquent. But words fail me. Really, you have to be there. So go there. Get the app. Just one word of warning – hide the iPad from your children until you’ve had plenty of play time of your own. If you don’t, it may be many years before you see this app again."" // Gill Robins ipadappreviewsby.gillrobins.com

""I downloaded Little Fox Music Box last night and my very active 18-month year old daughter (who doesn’t typically stay still for longer than 15 seconds) sat on my lap laughing, clapping, and interacting with the scenes for at least 30 minutes and wasn’t ready to stop(....)It´s a fantastic app!"" // Leanna Loft imore.com

NOTE: This game requires an iPad 2 / iPad Mini or newer

-- ABOUT THE GAME --

You've won a trip to Starlight City and find yourself in charge of Papa's latest restaurant, where you'll need to run the fryers and toss chicken wings in an assortment of flavorful sauces.  Your customers expect a great presentation, so arrange the fried foods with sides and veggies so they're pleasing to the eye -- and their stomachs!

Though the restaurant is known for its famous wings, you'll also unlock a variety of other meats to fry for your customers, as well as a wide array of delicious sauces and plenty of sides and dips to go with their meal.  The familiar hands-on gameplay of the series is back, but this time you'll especially have to focus on presentation and how to best lay out the plate with all of the food ordered.  Learn a variety of patterns for arranging the food to earn the best scores from your customers, and earn big tips to spend in the Shop!

-- NEW FEATURES --

This brand-new edition of Papa's Wingeria stocks the restaurant with additional meats, sauces, and sides that aren't found in any previous version of the game!  You can also serve 20 new customers that didn't appear in the original version, for a total of 89 unique customers that will visit the Wingeria.

You can choose to play as either Chuck or Mandi, and the custom characters from ""Papa's Freezeria HD"" return with even more hairstyles and new customization options.  You can also find an expanded wardrobe of clothing for your workers in the Shop, where you can buy new clothing and accessories with your hard-earned tips.

Papa's Wingeria HD now features a Dining Room where customers can sit down and enjoy their wings, and you'll be able to hire a Server to help you take orders and deliver food to the seated customers.  You can hire Chuck or Mandi as your Server, or create another custom character to staff your restaurant.  Any clothing and accessories you buy in the Shop can be used by both of your workers, so you can coordinate their uniforms or give them each their own style!

Play Foodini's Mini-Games after each workday to earn new clothing for your workers and furniture for your restaurant.  Complete all of the levels in each Mini-Game to earn a special Rare Prize with extra points for your lobby decoration score!  Complete all of the levels again to earn a second and then a third Rare Prize to complete your collection!

The customizable lobby is back, with new themes of furniture and new posters for decorating your shop.  You can change the wallpaper, flooring, countertop, and trim, which will also change the decor in the Dining Room as well!

Si no sou professionals del sector del taxi, sinó usuaris que voleu fer ús del servei, si us plau, no us descarregueu aquesta aplicació. En aquest cas, descarregueu-vos l’app AMB Mobilitat. 

El servei Picmi Taxi permet que, des de l’aplicació multimodal AMB Mobilitat, els clients puguin sol·licitar un taxi que els reculli de manera immediata, sense haver d’indicar la seva destinació. Els clients no poden fer reserves, només indiquen el punt de recollida perquè hi vagi el taxi que els assigni el sistema. 

Amb l'aplicació Picmi Pro, els taxistes reben al telèfon mòbil peticions Picmi dels usuaris que demanen un taxi. Picmi Pro localitza els taxistes més propers al punt de recollida indicat pel client i fa una petició per comprovar-ne la disponibilitat. El servei s'assigna al taxi que trigui menys a arribar al punt de recollida, i es prioritzen els taxistes que faci més temps que estan estacionats a les parades de taxi.

Els taxistes també poden veure la ubicació i l'ocupació de les parades de tota l'àrea metropolitana de Barcelona.

Els conductors de taxi que tinguin un servei Picmi assignat podran veure la ubicació del punt de recollida del client, accedir a la ruta i veure el temps estimat d'arribada. Si en arribar no troben el client, podran enviar un avís per indicar que han arribat al punt de recollida. 

Els principals objectius del servei són:
-	Augmentar el volum de demanda de taxis
-	Reduir els temps entre trajectes
-	Fer rutes més eficients

Només en cas d'incidències justificades reglamentàriament, el taxista podrà cancel·lar el servei tot indicant-ne el motiu. Picmi Pro també tindrà disponible el detall de tots els serveis realitzats pel taxista mitjançant l'aplicació, a l'historial d'ús del menú principal.

-- ABOUT THE GAME --

Papa's Cupcakeria has opened in the picturesque town of Frostfield, and you're in charge of baking and decorating cupcakes in the shop!  Work your way through all of the holidays of the year, and master all four stations of the restaurant to become a cupcake crafting master.

You'll need to multitask to handle all of the separate areas of the restaurant, and each step is a hands-on process.  Choose the correct pan liners and pour just the right amount of gooey batter into each.  Slide the pan into the oven and bake them to perfection.  Twist and swirl frosting onto the cupcakes, and carefully shake and drizzle the correct toppings onto each.  Add festive decorations on top, and serve the delicious cupcakes to your hungry customers!

-- GAME FEATURES --

Holidays have arrived on your tablet!  As you level up and build a loyal customer fan base, you'll notice the seasons changing all around you, bringing exciting new holidays on a regular basis.  You'll unlock a variety of batters, drizzles, shakers, and toppers for each holiday of the year, including some brand-new holidays that weren't included in the classic game!  Each customer has a favorite holiday, and will visit the shop to order something special with these holiday ingredients during their favorite season.

Play as James or Willow, or create your own custom character to work in the Cupcakeria!  Visit the Shop to find an extensive wardrobe of clothing and accessories for your workers, which you can buy with your hard-earned tips.  In this new version of Papa's Cupcakeria, there is also a wide selection of holiday-themed clothing that you can wear to get in the holiday spirit. If your worker is wearing clothing that matches the current holiday, your customers will give you even more tips!

The restaurant also includes a Dining Room where customers can sit and enjoy their freshly-baked cupcakes, and you can hire a Server to help you take their orders.  Hire James or Willow as your Server, or create another custom character to staff your restaurant.  All of the clothing and accessories you buy in the Shop can be used by both of your workers, so you can coordinate their uniforms or give them each their own style!

The customizable lobby is back, with new themes of furniture and decorations for each holiday of the year!  Decorate the restaurant with holiday decorations and your customers won't mind waiting even longer for their food.  You can also change the wallpaper, flooring, countertop, and trim, which will change the decor in the Dining Room as well!

Play Foodini's Mini-Games after each workday to earn new clothing for your workers and furniture for your restaurant.  Complete all of the levels in each Mini-Game to earn a special Rare Prize with extra points for your lobby decoration score!  Complete all of the levels again to earn a second and then a third Rare Prize to complete your collection!

It produces words and speech based on what the sensors in your phone are detecting.

The idea is that spirits are said to be able to manipulate the device to say and show relevant words and responses to questions being asked during a paranormal investigation. 

The Spirit Talker is a modern form of ITC (Instrumental Trans Communication) and is very simple to use. Just click start and begin asking your questions. When a response is detected by the app the words will show visually in the text box along with audible speech. When you have finished your session just click stop. You can also look back at the responses you received during your session by clicking on the folder button.

Flick your finger and make a homerun.
You can experience a real baseball batting through the physical pendulum. 

This is a game in which you can experience various throws based on the pendulum. The ball will fly further if you can hit the ball directly with the quick flick. Experience a “real-life like” batting simulation. 


■ Easy Control---------------------------
You only use flick to control the batting for this game. The more accurate you flick your finger to hit the ball; it is more likely that you will be a home-run hitter. 
The rule is simple. Flick your finger with the same feeling in which you would swing a bat in real life. Think of your finger as a bat, and flick it with speed and accuracy. That’s all.

■ Movement of the ball------------------
Various kinds of throws are materialized into “real-life like” feelings. Different pitches pull out different various kinds of movements. Thus, the batter may miss the timing and would be hard to hit.

■ 10 GAME mode------------------------
You can enjoy this game through 5 kinds of mode.
Minor & Major Mode- Hit as many home-runs as you can; as far as you can.
Multiplayer Mode- You can compete with other players via Game Center.
Moon-Star Mode- Try for a record with the given 9 balls.
Training Mode- You can practice with different kinds of pitches.
*Bunt mode ( need minor 15step): Drop the ball on the target of the floor correctly.
*Total mode ( need bunt 10000 point ) : You’ll meet many different types of the balls from the beginning of the game.
*Faster & faster ( need total 25000 point ) : Head-to-head with only fastballs.
*Jiant mode ( need F&F 10000 point ) : Match with a Giant pitcher
*Cutter mode ( need Jiant 12000 point ) : Match with cutterballs which can cut the baseball bat.

■ add 28 Achievement Bonus--------------
1 Achievement = 1 level up bonus!!!
 
■ Level Up System-----------------------
You can choose and upgrade 1 of 3 skills every time the exp becomes full.-
Power: You can increase the power of the bat
Accuracy: You can increase the accuracy of the batting
Batting Eye: You can know ahead of the next ball’s pattern 

■ Home-Run Tip!---------------------------
1.Make a full swing with a fast batting-speed!
2.Hit the ball followed from the various thrown pattern with an accurate swing!
3.Let’s keep an eye on the ball until the end and predict the change of the pattern!
4.Let’s be confident and make a full swing!

Introducing Endless Paper, an all-new kind of App featuring an infinite canvas which lets you take handwritten notes, sketch diagrams, explore and grow ideas visually, brainstorm with your team, organize your thoughts spatially, and so much more…
Deliberately simple yet powerful, incredibly fast, Endless Paper is as natural to use as pen & paper without the limitations of physical medium.

Whether you're an engineer needing to visualize a problem, a designer wireframing your next UI, a student taking notes, a teacher giving captivating lectures, a manager brainstorming on the next big thing with your team, a scientist working on long formulas, Endless Paper is the ideal tool to help you think and communicate visually.

Highlights:
• Infinite canvas
• Spatial organization
• Broadcast your whiteboard on the web
• Designed & optimized for iPad & Apple Pencil
• Powered by Fractile: Metal-accelerated, 64-bit vector rendering engine
• Drag & Drop of images
• Color wheel with nearly 120 hand-picked colors & Advanced HSB Chooser
• Bookmarks to quickly retrieve your content
• Toolbar optimized for two hands operations
• Presentation mode with support for Bluetooth remote/clickers
• Unlimited undo and redo
• Continuous auto-save

The Best Whiteboard
Have you ever started to sketch an idea on paper only to find out you won't have enough room to finish? With Endless Paper, you will never have to re-start from scratch on a blank page, to erase your whiteboard to make room, or, more importantly, to limit yourself because of the lack of space.
Every big idea starts small, and we know how fragile nascent ideas can be, so we deliberately designed a malleable tool that encourages exploration when you need it the most, when your ideas are the most vulnerable.

Organize your Content Spatially
Spatial organization is prevalent in our daily life: your kitchen, your desk, the city you live in, are all organized spatially. A calendar is time turned into space.
Yet most of our digital tools deprive us of this profoundly humane organization method.
Thanks to its unique infinite canvas, Endless Paper lets you organize your content spatially.
You can focus on the minute details of your project and quickly step back to see the big picture. 
It gives a sense of place to your work without artificial separation between document management and the documents themselves. 
Everything you can do on the document level can be done at any level. It all just works in a surprisingly consistent way.

Worth a Thousand Words
Import images directly onto your canvas.
Make your notes come alive. Collect ideas in mood boards. Take pictures and pin them.
Import study material, stickies, or that paper template you rely on.
Endless Paper supports drag & drop from Photos, Files, Safari...just about any app really.

Deceptively Simple, Incredibly Powerful
Endless Paper is designed to be natural to use. But this is no purposeless minimalism.
Interactions are as simple as possible in order to minimize errors & cognitive load.
This lets you dedicate 100% of your brain to the task at hand.
Interactions feel second nature, especially important in stressful situations or when you hand over your iPad to someone who has never used the App before.
And in case you made a mistake, you have unlimited undo & redo and everything saves automatically.

Designed for iPad & Apple Pencil
The tailor-made Fractile vector rendering engine delivers unparalleled level of performance: Whenever you are panning, zooming or writing, you always get ultra-crisp, retina quality, vector rendering at a silky smooth 120fps, even with millions of strokes simultaneously on screen.
Canvases accumulating years’ worth of notes will open instantly. No sweat.
It all participates in an almost unreal, magical experience.","Productivity,Education",Endless Paper,$9.99

BruxApp is the first globally available, research-based smartphone app dedicated to the study and management of Bruxism and its health consequences.
Designed by top international experts in a multi-center Bruxism research project and developed in 25 Research Centres across the world. 

WHAT CAN IT DO?
Bruxapp is a simple tool used by dentists and patients for several purposes:
- To help the assessment  of the presence/absence of bruxism-related activities (i.e., teeth clenching or grinding, jaw clenching) and potential consequences.
- For rating the severity of bruxism, if present.
- As a biofeedback-based management tool for bruxism.
- To increase patients’ awareness of bruxism activities so they can avoid or correct negative habits.
- To make patients aware of the possible clinical consequences of bruxism and try to prevent them.
- To promote cutting-edge knowledge about bruxism, based on the latest scientific research.

WHY is BruxApp needed? 
Bruxism has been increasing in prevalence over recent years. It encompasses motor activities of the jaw muscles, such as jaw or teeth clenching, and teeth grinding, some of which may be associated with clinical signs and symptoms, like tooth wear, failed dental restorations, complications with implant-supported prosthesis, muscle fatigue and temporomandibular joint pain. A correct diagnosis is therefore fundamental to establishing early prevention and management regimens.

SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH
Studies with BruxApp have been supervised by experts, as part of an ongoing multicenter research project on bruxism epidemiology and management coordinated by Prof. Daniele Manfredini, University of Siena, Italy.

DEVELOPMENT
The app was developed by Goran Djukic, program analyst at the Institute of Clinical Physiology, National Council of Research, University of Pisa, Italy.
BruxApp is currently available in the following languages: English, Italian, , French, Portuguese, German, Spanish, Dutch, Finnish, Brazilian, Japanese, Hebrew, Chinese, Arabic, Greek, Polish, Lithuanian, Bosnian, Romanian, Turkish, Norwegian, and Croatian, with another 4 language versions soon to be released. 

IMPORTANT STATEMENT
BruxApp is not a game or gadget.  In order for BruxApp to work correctly and be effective, please dedicate 5 minutes of your time to READING the simple instructions CAREFULLY. 

The full compatibility is guaranteed by iPhone 6 and higher ones and iOS 9.3 and higher ones.","Health & Fitness,Medical",BruxApp,$1.99

Q: Can I create or edit sheet music with this app?
A: Unlike Guitar Pro for Windows and Mac, this app does not let you change the notation in an existing Guitar Pro file, or create sheet music in standard notation. It is however possible to edit a single-track tablature with the NotePad tool and export your work into .gpx and .gp formats to finish your composition in Guitar Pro 6 or 7.

Hinge is the dating app for people who want to get off dating apps. And it’s working. Currently, 3 out of 4 times Hinge members want to go on a second date, we’re the #1 mobile-first dating app mentioned in the New York Times wedding section, and we’re the fastest growing dating app in the US, UK, Canada, and Australia.

HOW WE GET YOU OFF HINGE
In today’s digital world, singles are so busy matching that they’re not actually connecting, in person, where it counts. Hinge is on a mission to change that. So we built an app that’s designed to be deleted.

* We quickly learn your type. You’ll only be introduced to the best people for you.

* We give you a sense of someone’s personality. You’ll get to know potential dates through their unique answers to prompts, and personal information like religion, height, and politics.

* We make it easy to start a conversation. Every match begins by someone liking or commenting on a specific part of your profile.

* We ask how your dates are going. After exchanging phone numbers with a Match, we’ll follow up to hear how your date went so we can make better recommendations in the future.

The app is free to use. Members looking to see who likes them or to set advanced preferences can upgrade to a Preferred Membership.

-- ABOUT THE GAME --

Your tour of Papa Louie's new restaurant goes awry when you break the lucky cat statue outside of the shop.  Is this to blame for the restaurant's underwhelming opening day?  When Papa Louie leaves on a mission to find a new statue, you're left in charge of Papa's Sushiria, where you need to master the fine art of sushi making!

You'll need to cook, season, and spread the rice onto nori and soy paper using the all-in-one ""Sushi Square"" cooker.  Add fillings to the sushi, and roll it up before placing toppings and drizzling sauces across the top.  Slice up the sushi into bite-sized pieces, and prepare a delicious Bubble Tea to serve alongside the order before serving it to your hungry customers.  Sakura Bay celebrates different holidays throughout the year, and you'll unlock new seasonal ingredients as you go for creating deliciously festive sushi and tea.

-- GAME FEATURES --

NEW FEATURES - All of your favorite features from other versions of Papa's restaurants are now available in this ""To Go"" game, redesigned and reimagined for smaller screens!

HOLIDAY FLAVORS - Celebrate the seasons in Sakura Bay with tasty holiday flavors!  Your customers will order delectable sushi made with seasonal ingredients.  You'll unlock new fillings, soy paper, sauces, toppings, and tea flavors for each holiday of the year, and your customers will love trying these festive flavors in their sushi rolls.

SERVE SPECIAL RECIPES - Earn Special Recipes from your customers, and serve them as the Daily Special in the Sushiria!  Each Special has a bonus you can earn for serving a prime example of that recipe.  Master each special to earn a special prize!

CUSTOMIZE YOUR WORKERS - Play as Matt or Clover, or create your own custom character to work in the sushi restaurant!  You can also show off your holiday spirit with a massive variety of holiday outfits and clothing for your workers.  Choose unique color combinations for each item of clothing, and create your own style with millions of combinations!

SPECIAL DELIVERY - Some customers don't want to travel all the way to Sakura Bay for fresh sushi.  When you start taking phone orders, customers can call to place their order, and you'll hire a Driver to help take and deliver orders to their homes instead!

COLLECT STICKERS - Complete a variety of tasks and achievements while playing to earn colorful Stickers for your collection.  Each customer has a set of three favorite Stickers: Earn all three and you'll be rewarded with a brand-new outfit to give to that customer!

DECORATE THE SHOP - Customize the Sushiria lobby with themed furniture and decorations for each holiday of the year!  Mix and match your favorite styles, or add items that match the current holiday so customers won't mind waiting longer for their food.

A few things you’ll find on Reddit…

■ Laughs, lols, and plenty of ridiculousness

■ The best discussions 
The real action is always in the comments. Reddit’s discussion threads are where community members jump in to provide commentary, humor, and insight. 
■ Answers to questions you’re too afraid to ask in public 
Recipes, street fashion, career help, fitness plans, and more—find ideas and inspiration for whatever you want to do.

Die App fungiert als digitale Ergänzung zu Abstandhalten, Hygiene und Alltagsmaske. Die App basiert auf Bluetooth-Technologie und der Exposure Notification API von Apple. Wer sie nutzt, hilft, Infektionsketten schnell nachzuverfolgen und zu durchbrechen. Außerdem bietet die App eine Funktionalität, mit der Sie digitale Impfzertifikate hinzufügen können, um damit Ihren Impfstatus nachzuweisen. Die App merkt sich dezentral unsere Begegnungen mit anderen und informiert uns digital, wenn wir Begegnungen mit nachweislich infizierten Personen hatten. Dabei sammelt sie jedoch zu keiner Zeit Informationen zur Identität ihrer Nutzerinnen und Nutzer. Wer wir sind und wo wir sind, bleibt geheim – und unsere Privatsphäre bestens geschützt.

WIE DIE APP FUNKTIONIERT

Die Risiko-Ermittlung der App ist das Herzstück der Software und sollte immer aktiviert sein. Wann immer sich Nutzerinnen und Nutzer begegnen, tauschen ihre Smartphones über Bluetooth verschlüsselte Zufalls-IDs aus.

Diese geben nur Auskunft darüber, über welche Dauer und mit welchem Abstand eine Begegnung stattfand. Welche Person sich hinter einem Code verbirgt, ist für niemanden nachvollziehbar. Die Corona-Warn-App erhebt keine Informationen über den Ort der Begegnung oder den Standort der Nutzerinnen und Nutzer.

Entsprechend der maximalen Corona-Inkubationszeit werden alle Zufalls-IDs, die unser Smartphone sammelt, für 14 Tage auf dem Smartphone gespeichert – und dann gelöscht.
Nur wenn eine Person sich über die App freiwillig als nachweislich infiziert meldet, erhalten daraufhin alle früheren Begegnungen eine Warnung auf ihr Smartphone.

Niemand erfährt, wann, wo oder mit wem eine entsprechende Risiko-Begegnung stattfand. Die infizierte Person bleibt anonym.

Mit der Benachrichtigung erhalten die betroffenen Nutzer/-innen klare Handlungsempfehlungen. Wichtig: Auch die Daten der Benachrichtigten sind zu keiner Zeit einsehbar.


WIE DIE DATEN SICHER BLEIBEN

Die Corona-Warn-App soll uns zwar täglich begleiten, sie wird uns jedoch nie kennenlernen. Dadurch kann sie niemandem verraten, wer wir sind. Der Datenschutz bleibt über die gesamte Nutzungsdauer zu 100 Prozent gewahrt.

• Keine Anmeldung: Es müssen keine E-Mail-Adresse und kein Name hinterlegt werden.
• Keine Rückschlüsse auf Identitäten: Bei einer Begegnung mit einem anderen Menschen tauschen die Smartphones nur Zufalls-IDs aus. Diese messen, über welche Dauer und mit welchem Abstand ein Kontakt stattfand. Sie lassen aber keine Rückschlüsse auf Personen und Standorte zu.
• Dezentrale Speicherung: Die Daten werden nur auf dem Smartphone gespeichert und nach 14 Tagen gelöscht.
• Keine Einsicht für Dritte: Sowohl die Personen, die eine nachgewiesene Infektion melden, als auch die Benachrichtigten sind nicht nachverfolgbar – nicht für die Bundesregierung, nicht für das Robert Koch-Institut, nicht für andere User und auch nicht für die Betreiber der App-Stores.

Diese App ist nicht zum Gebrauch außerhalb Deutschlands bestimmt. Die Corona-Warn-App ist die zentrale Corona-App für Deutschland und sie ist an das deutsche Gesundheitssystem angeschlossen. Trotzdem ist die Corona-Warn-App auch in diesem Land verfügbar. Sie ist gedacht für alle, die in Deutschland leben, arbeiten, Urlaub machen oder sich regelmäßig oder über längere Zeit in Deutschland aufhalten.

Live map markers continually update distance/heading relative to the current location and also show wayfinding info in the main viewfinder. Draw polygons on the map to mark things like property boundaries and trails, and import/export polygon data via KML.

Share map markers and nav calculator points with other users of Theodolite via text messages or e-mail. This powerful capability opens up a wide range of collaborative uses including team land surveying, accident investigations, spotting wild fires, triangulation of landmarks, and advanced tactical observation and targeting. With an optional in-app purchase to enable team tracking, you can share location with up to 20 people on Theodolite's map.

Theodolite includes features for serious users like a reference angle mode, nav calculator, map marker import/export, manual and automatic data logging with CSV and KML export, clipboard integration, %grade display, mil compass readout, optical rangefinders (including a mil-based reticle, sniper-style stadiametric graphs, and a variable 4X-24X scope), and night filters to improve use in dark conditions.

Theodolite can provide location in military grid reference system (MGRS) coordinates, Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates, British/Irish National Grids, US National Grid, Maidenhead locator system, Map Grid of Australia, and six latitude/longitude formats. Optional US State Plane coordinates include SPCS27 and SPCS83 zones covering all US States. The optional Datum Pack adds over 230 geodetic datums to the app to improve position computation from GPS data, covering regions and countries on all continents around the world.

AR Layers include navigational aids like the sun, moon, planets, and Polaris (North star), and the optional US Mountain Summits layer that shows over 70,000 US mountain summits in the viewfinder.

Theodolite has been shown in Apple Keynotes, featured on the App Store, and has been a #1 selling Navigation app in App Stores around the world. Since its introduction in 2009, Theodolite has defined augmented reality navigation. The app continually introduces new technologies, pushing the limits of iOS app development and taking advantage of new hardware capabilities.

For each mushroom there is a comprehensive description and a selection of images of different perspectives and life tilt. Not only occasional collectors will have their fun with the app - mycologists will enjoy it, too, as the content of the app has been compiled by Dr. GERHARDT, author of many mushroom books and scientific publications about mycology. Dr. GERHARDT has been a long term employee and consultant of Mycology at the Botanical Gardens and in the Botanical Museum of Berlin.


SO HOW CAN A MUSHROOM BE IDENTIFIED?

You can choose from a variety of visual and other characteristic features and thus reduce the list of eligible mushroom species.


YOUR PERSONAL TRAINER!

* Learning* with a picture quiz. Polyporus Brumalis, Echinoderma Asperum or rather Armillaria Ostoyae? In case you don't know the right answer to a question, you still have 2 more mushroom lives to go. You can post your score in the high score board.


BUT... THERE'S NO INTERNET CONNECTION IN THE WOODS!

No worries, you only require connectivity for the initial installation and for installing updates so you can always use new features.

Grill, stack, and serve burgers in a brand-new way!  

You're left in charge of Papa Louie's famous Burgeria, where you'll learn to take orders, grill patties, add toppings, and serve burgers to all of your crazy customers.  You need to multitask between each area of the restaurant, with new controls that feel just right in the palm of your hand: Head to the Order Station to keep an eye out for customers waiting in the lobby.  Switch to the Grill Station to drag patties onto the grill and flip burgers to cook them evenly.  Jump to the Build Station to carefully craft your sandwiches with toppings and sauces exactly how they ordered, and deliver the finished burger to earn points and tips!

Each Station is a hands-on experience, where you'll need to drag, swipe, and tap your way through the burger-building process.  With full multi-touch support, the process is more fun than ever before!  Tap many burgers at once to flip them all on the grill, or keep one finger on the Build Station's bin slider for even better precision when building.

Keep your customers happy to earn more points and level up. As your level rises, you'll unlock new toppings in the shop, and new customers will start visiting the Burgeria!  Papa's Burgeria To Go also features unlockable toppings that aren't available in previous versions!

**NEW FOR PAPA'S BURGERIA TO GO**

Papa's Burgeria To Go is redesigned and reimagined for smaller screens, so your fingers won't get in the way of the action!

CONTROL WITH YOUR THUMBS - You'll switch stations using buttons in the corners of the screen, perfect for your thumbs.  Use buttons in the top corners to switch Order Tickets without having to drag them back and forth.  You can also view all of your Order Tickets in a zoomed-in mode for easy reading.

GRILL STATION - We've made keeping track of your burgers easier than ever, with Timers stuck in each burger patty that you can read at a glance, showing the cooking time and how each side is cooked.  You can also buy Alarms in the Shop to add onto each Timer, so you'll get an alert when it's time to flip or remove a burger.  With multi-touch support, you can quickly flip and remove burgers by using multiple fingers.  Try a triple-tap to flip three patties in a row!

BUILD STATION - With a traditional drag-and-drop system, your finger would block your view, so we've completely changed the Build Station to work on smaller screens.  You'll swipe a carousel of Topping Bins across the top of the screen, and slide it carefully to line up toppings with the burger below.  Simply tap on the bottom of the screen to drop a topping from the bin above!  You can also tap a button to swap your Topping Bins with Burger Bins, which hold all of the patties you've cooked on the grill.  And with full multi-touch support, you can keep one finger sliding the bins and another tapping on the bottom of the screen, so stacking burgers is a breeze!

Die App, vom geprüften Ausbilder für zukünftige Ausbilder erstellt, beinhaltet mehr als 500 ausgewählte Fragen aus allen vier Handlungsfeldern, die teilweise ähnlich denen in der Original Ausbildereignungsprüfung der zuständigen Stellen (IHK und teilweise HWK) aufgebaut sind. Im Zuge der kompakten Darstellung für mobile Endgeräte wurde allerdings, abweichend zu den Originalprüfungen in Papierform, auf umfangreiche Texteinleitungen verzichtet. Die Aufgaben sind im Multiple-Choice-Verfahren angelegt und haben, wie bei der echten Prüfung auch, eine oder mehrere richtige Antworten. Die Reihenfolge der Fragen und zugehörigen Antworten ändert sich bei jedem Durchlauf.

Besonders viel Wert wurde bei der Erstellung der App auf eine einfache und intuitive Bedienung nach den Apple Design Empfehlungen gelegt. Sie können wie bei der realen Prüfung frei zwischen den Fragen springen und diese so in beliebiger Reihenfolge beantworten sowie ggf. nachträglich korrigieren.

Die App ist in mehrere Module unterteilt:
Ein Lernmodul bietet die Möglichkeit, anhand einer Anzahl zufällig ausgewählter Fragen aus den verschiedenen Handlungsfeldern zu trainieren oder alle zuletzt markierten Fragen erneut durchzugehen.
Im Lernmodul können Sie sich jederzeit die richtigen Lösungen anzeigen lassen. Gleichfalls lassen sich jederzeit weitere Fragen auf die Merkliste setzen und später erneut abrufen. Gelernte Fragen können einfach entsprechend markiert werden und werden dann nicht mehr abgefragt.

Das Prüfungsmodul erlaubt die Durchführung einer Prüfungssituation mit einer festen üblichen Anzahl Fragen. Abweichend zum Lernmodul läuft hier die Zeit mit und beim Abschluss der Prüfung erfolgt eine Bewertung nach offiziellen AEVO-Richtlinien.

Das Auswertungsmodul gibt Ihnen ein detailliertes Feedback über Ihre bisher durchgeführten Prüfungen. Bereits abgeschlossene Prüfungen lassen sich erneut abrufen und so Defizite leicht erkennen. Anhand der übersichtlichen Auswertung fällt es Ihnen leicht zu entscheiden, ob Sie sich bereits ausreichend auf die schriftliche Prüfung nach der AEVO vorbereitet haben.

Außerdem enthält die App noch ein Seite mit Tipps, die Ihnen helfen sollen, damit Sie sich bei der echten Prüfung bei der IHK (und teilweise HWK) sicherer fühlen.

Wir wünschen Ihnen viel Erfolg auf Ihrem Weg zum Ausbilder und für Ihren Ausbilderschein.

The app is aimed at 5-11 year olds. There are 166 different game modes of varying difficulty so it is useful throughout grades K-5. Answer as many questions as possible in minute-long games, or you can now practice without the pressure of a countdown timer - a feature which is new for 2019. Questions are randomly generated which means it is very replayable. The game has been carefully designed for children, with large, widely spaced buttons. We recommend that young children play on a tablet.

Six main topics are covered: 

* Times tables - up to 10 or 12 
* Division - up to 10 or 12
* Square numbers
* Number bonds
* Doubling 
* Halving

Between these topics, the four standard arithmetic operations are covered: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.

You can create up to 30 player profiles per device to track an individual's high scores (increased from 15 in 2019). If you prefer there's also the option to play as a guest. All data is stored locally on your device so you don't have to worry about privacy issues. We've also made it very easy for children to quickly switch between profiles after playing a game, if they're sharing a device.

After each game, the score achieved is displayed along with the child's high score. Bronze, silver or gold stars and trophies are awarded depending on the score achieved in each game.",Education,Hit the Button Math,$3.99

- Volume
- Pan (represented by width in the visualizer)
- Size ( = grain’s duration)
- Density ( = frequency of grains generation)
- Offset ( = the amount of time between record and play represented by the depth in the 3D visualizer)
- Backward/Forward Playback Direction
- Shape ( = grain’s envelope, represented by the height dimension in the visualizer)
- Warmth ( = strength of the distortion applied to the grain)
- Tune ( = grains can be pitched up or down according to different modes: “Fine”  / Chromatic / Major / Minor / 5th / Major 7th. / Minor 7th / Octave)

The amount of randomization can be set with the “dice” knobs.
Density, grain size and offset range can be freely synced or beat synced to the host’s tempo.
Touching and holding the visualizer modifies pan and density.

BLEASS Granulizer takes up to 4 sources from different busses as inputs (compatible host required). When multiple busses are on, each grain is randomly extracted from one of the available sources.

The purpose of Muzz is to help analyze an audio signal to understand the characteristics of this signal (fundamental, harmonics, feedback, etc.), to describe the source/room/receiver behavior. This is achieved by providing a set of above 20 different spectrum analyzers to visualize audio data.
This app can be very useful to analyze and equalize the audio response of a hall, or for educational purposes, and more. The Muzz spectrum analyzer is up to any challenge. Whether simple outdoor or indoor frequency monitoring, we got it!

There are above 20 different spectrum graph types for running your audio analysis. Here is a short explanation about few of them:

Spectrum: This Visualization view renders a visualization of the simple one-dimensional spectrum (using a mean-square amplitude scale) of the music.
LinearOAS: This Visualization that shows an amplitude vs. exponential-frequency spectrum of the audio waveform. The horizontal axis covers a total of 6 octaves.
EllipticalOAS: This visualization generates the same FFT spectral information and displays it as a series of concentric ellipses instead of as rows in a Cartesian grid. 
Cymbal:  This visualization is inspired by contemplating the vibrational patterns of a cymbal.
OutOfTheRabbitHole:  This visualization renders the time-history of the music's spectrum across a sequence of circles.

App features included: 
Play / Pause 
When clicked it stops the music playback and freezes the visualization display. When clicked again, the music playback and visual display will continue.
 
Mic
When clicked the app starts live audio mode from the device microphone and starts the selected visualization. Another click on the Mic button will end the live audio and start again the playback mode.

Folder
When clicked, a sub-window pops up to allow selection of an audio file to play from the current device.
 
Peak enhancer
When clicked, it passes the audio signal through a filter which enhances the display of spectral lines, mostly the harmonic of musical notes and reduces display of noise such as percussive effects. Another click will remove this filter.
 
Visualization Algorithm Option
There are several variations available for producing visual spectrum analysis. By clicking this button, each graph will display another optional data added. For example, adding delay on Spectrum Bars graph. Delay is helpful for examining the visual data more carefully. In many graphs this option button is adding visual data or another variation of showing the spectrum. 
 
Dark mode
When clicked it changes the spectrum background mode to light or dark mode. By default the background is set to dark mode. Some visualizations look much better in a certain mode, therefore it is advised to try this option on your selected spectrum graph.

Visualization Gain and Visualization Treble
Sliding these controls left and right will adjust the gain and the slope of the visual data. They will not change the audio level but subjectively enhance the display to get better focused data if needed.","Utilities,Music",Muzz - Audio Spectrum Analyzer,$10.99

BE WARNED. This game has no tutorial - part of the challenge is figuring out how to play. It's hard, but keep trying, and you'll master it. Good luck!

In this infamous roguelike narrative card game, play as a seeker after unholy mysteries in a 1920s-themed setting of hidden gods and secret histories. Become a scholar of the unseen arts. Craft tools and summon spirits. Indoctrinate innocents. Seize your place as the herald of a new age.

Cultist Simulator was first released on PC and has more than 200,000 players all over the world. Now we’re bringing the cosmic mysteries of Cultist Simulator to mobile.

• Challenging roguelike gameplay - There is never only one history.
Cultist Simulator doesn’t hold your hand. Experiment, expire and transcend death with a story-driven legacy system. Over time you’ll learn enough to wrestle the game to its knees.

• Intense, immersive narrative – Combine cards to tell your own story.
A hefty novel’s worth of choice-based storytelling, from the creator of Fallen London and Sunless Sea. There are many paths through this game of ambition, appetite and abomination, and many ways your tale can end.

• A rich Lovecraftian world – Corrupt your friends and consume your enemies.
Search your dreams for sanity-twisting rituals. Translate grimoires and glean their lore. Penetrate the realm of the Hours and win a place in their service. Cultist Simulator brings the peripheral horror of Lovecraft’s tales to an entirely new setting.

Expand your knowledge with the DLCs: New Legacies, New Ascensions, New Mechanics...

• The Priest - Knock, and Ye Shall Be Opened

-- ABOUT THE GAME --

After missing out on your dream job, Papa Louie helps you out by hiring you to run Papa's Bakeria, a brand-new restaurant located in Whiskview Mall!  This big-time bakery serves the most sought-after pies in town, and gets plenty of foot traffic from some of the pickiest customers around.  

You'll need to prepare pies with delicious crusts and flavorful fillings, then top the pie with various crust designs, meringues, or crumbles before popping it in the oven.  After the pie has baked, it's time to decorate it with a wide array of drizzles, shakers, and toppings before serving a slice to your hungry customers.  Whiskview Mall is decorated to celebrate different holidays throughout the year, and you'll unlock new festive ingredients as you go for delicious seasonal pies.

-- GAME FEATURES --

You'll unlock new fillings, crust designs, syrups, and toppings for each holiday of the year, and your customers will love trying these festive flavors.

You can also show off your holiday spirit with a massive variety of holiday outfits and clothing for your workers.  Choose unique color combinations for each item of clothing, and create your own style with millions of combinations!

SPECIAL DELIVERY - Some customers don't want to come all the way to Whiskview Mall for fresh pies.  When you start taking phone orders, customers can call to place their order, and you'll hire a Driver to help take and deliver orders to their homes instead!

COLLECT STICKERS - Complete a variety of tasks and achievements while playing to earn colorful Stickers for your collection.  Each customer has a set of three favorite Stickers: Earn all three and you'll be rewarded with a brand-new outfit to give to that customer!

8 Sounds Banks:

The audio has been mastered in a way to bring out various sound properties . 
Using Pro Tools I was able to enhance high, mid, and low range frequencies. I also applied 
other filters to create unique sound characteristics to help layer the audio and create an 
environment suitable for spirit communication.

The audio itself is made up of phonemes, 
partial words, reverse audio, foreign languages, and other parts of speech that can help 
spirits communicate. Besides some basic phonetic sounds such as na, no, da, do, di, ma, may, etc.
there are no real words of phrases contained in the banks.

These sounds banks play in a similar
way to that of my other app ""Spiritus Ghost Box"" but instead of 4 sound banks Necrophonic has
8 active sound banks.

White Noise Sound Bank:

This app also has an optional 9th sound bank called ""White noise"". 
This bank can be used alone or with the other 8 giving you a total of 9 sound banks. This 
audio is taken for the internal sounds of the famous DR60 recorder that is known as the 
""Holy Grail"" of EVP recorders. This is not a White Noise Generator, this is a normal sound bank like the others but this one contains white noise from the DR60.

Audio Effects:

This app does contain Echo and Reverb audio effects. These have been proven 
to be the best effects to apply to ITC sessions. The echo can create audio that can be 
manipulated within the echo itself. Echo can also help in live, real time communication by 
repeating the audio and allowing you to better hear whats coming through. Reverb can be 
applied to the audio to create a spacious sound environment that will enhance audio manipulation.","Utilities,Entertainment",Necrophonic,$9.99

Adapted from the award-winning board game from Tabletop Tycoon, Everdell is a fantastical city building game combining worker placement and strategic card play to create a new civilization.  Gather resources to build fanciful Constructions and recruit colorful Critters to make your city thrive. Each card in your city scores points, and after four seasons have passed the highest-scoring city wins!

Face off against other founders in cross-platform multiplayer games, or test your civic wits with AI play and Solo Challenges!


On each turn, you'll take one of three actions:

1.) Place a Worker. Send one of your helpful workers out into the valley to gather resources! Berries, Twigs, Resin, Pebbles...and of course Cards! You'll need them all to help your new civilization grow.

2.) Play a Card. Your city can hold up to 15 Construction and Critter cards. Cards generate resources, open up new abilities, and score points to win the game! Discover combos and synergies to race past your opponents.

3.) Prepare for the Next Season. When the seasons change, your workers come home and get ready for the next round. But plan your city carefully! After four seasons, the Winter Moon returns and the game will end.

Vor fünf Jahren hat Carl Johnson es geschafft, den Problemen von Los Santos zu entkommen - einer Stadt im Staat San Andreas, die in Bandenkriegen, Drogen und Korruption zu versinken droht.

Doch kaum zurück in seiner alten Heimat, hängen ihm einige korrupte Cops einen Mord an. CJ muss weg... auf eine Reise, die ihn durch ganz San Andreas führt, um seine Familie zu retten und die Straßen unter seine Kontrolle zu bringen.

Features:
• Instant calculation.
• The result is copy able to another app.
• The formula is included as reference.
• Support various unit for each input.

Waist-hip ratio or Waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) is the ratio of the circumference of the waist to that of the hips. It is calculated by measuring the smallest circumference of the natural waist, usually just above the belly button, and dividing by the hip circumference at its widest part of the buttocks or hip. The ratio is applied both to women and men.
For example, a person with a 32″ waist and 37″ hips has a waist-hip ratio of about 0.86.

It's not only the amount of body fat you have, but also where in your body the fat is stored that impacts on your health. Adults who store most of their body fat around their waists have an increased risk of high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, heart disease and stroke compared with those who have the same amount of body fat stored around their hips and thighs.

Measuring your waist-to-hip ratio is an easy way to see how much weight you are carrying around your abdomen as opposed to around your hips. 
Measurement:
- Waist measurement with stomach relaxed, measure waist at its narrowest point which normally at your navel or belly-button.
- Hip measurement during standing, measure hips at widest point or around the bony prominence. 

WHR for Male 
0.90 or lower - normal weight    
0.90 to 0.99 - over-weight        
1.0 or higher - obese                

WHR for Female 	
0.80 or lower - normal weight
0.81 to 0.84 - over-weight
0.85 or higher - obese

The WHR has been used as an indicator or measure of health, and as a risk factor for developing serious health conditions.

WHR is used as a measurement of obesity, which in turn is a possible indicator of other more serious health conditions. The WHO states that abdominal obesity is defined as a waist–hip ratio above 0.90 for males and above 0.85 for females, or a body mass index (BMI) above 30.0. The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) states that ""total cholesterol levels are usually higher in persons with predominant abdominal obesity, defined as a waist-to-hip circumference ratio of ≥ 0.8 for women and ≥ 1.0 for men.

Waist to Hip Ratio Calculator is for informational or educational purposes only, and does not substitute professional medical advice or consultations with healthcare professionals. Please seek a doctor’s advice in addition to using this app and before making any medical decisions.

These are just a few of the day to day conveniences this app will help achieve:

 - Forgot to plug in? Get a notification if vehicle is in a pre-configured location and not plugged in - all done directly on the watch, no external servers required, keeping your privacy!

 - Add the graphic corner complication to your watch face and enjoy the convenience of having easy access to state of charge, charging indicator, time remaining if charging, sentry mode active indicator and indicator if any windows, doors or trunks are open. All from one complication, that also will launch the app when tapped. 

 - During and after charge, a panel will show how much energy was added. Convenient if you schedule your charge during the night - wake up each morning and easily check how much energy was added to the battery. 

 - If you have multiple vehicles on your account, tap the vehicle name to quickly and easily switch between them. 

 - You can queue up commands by tapping on buttons, then put your wrist down and the commands will execute in the background when the vehicle is successfully woken up. 

 - When you tap the unlock vehicle button, the charge port will also unlock if a charging cable is attached. That's convenience right there!

 - Want to reduce phantom drain? Background updates can be configured to longer intervals between updates or to only update if car is already awake or can be disabled entirely for absolutely zero impact on phantom drain.

 - A warning panel will show up if any doors, windows or trunks are left open. Conveniently, you can tap the panel to close any open windows.

 - Need to access the frunk? Just do it from your wrist - no fiddling with your phone. 

 - Sitting comfy in the couch, but just remembered you have a road-trip in the morning? Set the charge limit to 100% - or any value really - and start charging, right from the convenience of your wrist!

 - Leaving the office after a long hot day? Activate the HVAC when you're on your way, and enjoy a nice cool vehicle.

 - When charging, tap the time remaining label to switch to show time of expected completion - no more head calculus!

 - Need to run a quick errand, but you don't have your phone? Unlock your vehicle from your wrist, then activate remote start and off you go. Just please be mindful that this feature requires internet connectivity on both watch and vehicle - so don't drive into the desert and leave your vehicle, or you'll get stuck there!

A note about security and privacy:
This app accepts two types of login. Either Tesla account credentials or a Tesla API token. Your account credentials are by default not stored in the app, but are used only once to obtain an authentication token and refresh token directly from the Tesla API server. If you would rather supply that token yourself, you can do so instead. It is preferable to supply a refresh token, as the app will then have a perpetual login. Your token will be persisted in the app. Tokens will be revoked if you change your Tesla account password. With the optional remote start feature you can choose to store your password in the app - it will be securely stored in the iOS / watchOS / iPadOS keychain. This feature is optional and is not required for all other features to function. No network traffic will ever be emitted from this app that goes anywhere other than directly to the Tesla API servers. The source code for this application will at all times be made available to any security researcher for a voluntary security and safety audit. 

Disclaimer: 
This app is not endorsed by Tesla Inc. Use at your own risk. No guarantee of proper function is given. Only you are responsible for any changes to your car caused by using this app.

LFOH! is a single oscillator LFO and has a set of continuously morphable and selectable waveforms that represents the core of its modulation signal. Apart from the classic frequency and phase parameters (which make it capable of all of the classic modulation stuff), the waveform can also be shaped by swinging its cycles, bending its curve, squeezing portions of oscillation in the same period of time, scaled and transformed while exceeding its boundaries. An additional Sample and Hold circuit provides quantization for the resulting signal.

A tool you already know, with the most advanced features: simple and powerful.

LFOH! is both an audio processor and a MIDI modulator: while is capable to send its modulation signal out as MIDI CC (according to the MIDI routing flexibility of the app that hosts it), it can also modulate the amplitude of incoming audio. 

*** Please note: LFOH! is an Audio Unit extension (AUv3) – it only works in an AUv3 host app like AUM, Drambo, Cubasis, etc... ***",Music,LFOH!,$1.99

Winkelen via de bol.com app kent tal van voordelen:

One of the world's top 10 most downloaded apps with over 500 million active users.

FAST: Telegram is the fastest messaging app on the market, connecting people via a unique, distributed network of data centers around the globe.

SYNCED: You can access your messages from all your phones, tablets and computers at once. Telegram apps are standalone, so you don’t need to keep your phone connected. Start typing on one device and finish the message from another. Never lose your data again.

UNLIMITED: You can send media and files, without any limits on their type and size. Your entire chat history will require no disk space on your device, and will be securely stored in the Telegram cloud for as long as you need it. 

SECURE: We made it our mission to provide the best security combined with ease of use. Everything on Telegram, including chats, groups, media, etc. is encrypted using a combination of 256-bit symmetric AES encryption, 2048-bit RSA encryption, and Diffie–Hellman secure key exchange. 

100% FREE & OPEN: Telegram has a fully documented and free API for developers, open source apps and verifiable builds to prove the app you download is built from the exact same source code that is published. 

POWERFUL: You can create group chats with up to 200,000 members, share large videos, documents of any type (.DOCX, .MP3, .ZIP, etc.) up to 2 GB each, and even set up bots for specific tasks. Telegram is the perfect tool for hosting online communities and coordinating teamwork.

RELIABLE: Built to deliver your messages using as little data as possible, Telegram is the most reliable messaging system ever made. It works even on the weakest mobile connections. 

FUN: Telegram has powerful photo and video editing tools, animated stickers and emoji, fully customizable themes to change the appearance of your app, and an open sticker/GIF platform to cater to all your expressive needs.

SIMPLE: While providing an unprecedented array of features, we take great care to keep the interface clean. Telegram is so simple you already know how to use it.

PRIVATE: We take your privacy seriously and will never give any third parties access to your data. You can delete any message you ever sent or received for both sides, at any time and without a trace. Telegram will never use your data to show you ads.

For those interested in maximum privacy, Telegram offers Secret Chats. Secret Chat messages can be programmed to self-destruct automatically from both participating devices. This way you can send all types of disappearing content — messages, photos, videos, and even files. Secret Chats use End-to-End Encryption to ensure that a message can only be read by its intended recipient.

We keep expanding the boundaries of what you can do with a messaging app. Don’t wait years for older messengers to catch up with Telegram — join the revolution today.

Whether you’re planning a photo shoot, a wedding, or a solar panel installation, tracking the sun and moon has never been easier!

Lumos is divided into six main modules:

• The augmented reality view harnesses the power of AR to visually project past, present, or future sun and moon positions (and moon phases!) onto your surroundings, letting you perfectly visualize your plans.

• The map view overlays the sun and moon positions for a given time and location onto a map of that location, letting you make plans from afar.

• The Street View mode works like the AR view, but it takes advantage of Google Street View to allow you to envision sun and moon positions for remote locations (requires Lumos Pro).

• The calendar view displays a simple list of rise/set times and moon phases throughout the year, letting you see the big picture at a glance. Tap a row to see the detailed ephemeris for that day.

• The notifications module lets you sign up to receive notifications for significant solar and lunar events, including: astronomical, nautical, and civil dawn/dusk, blue hour, golden hour, sunrise/set, solar noon, moon rise/set, lunar transit, and lunar perigee/apogee (requires Lumos Pro).

• The shadow length view calculates the exact length of the shadow an object will cast on a given time and day, letting you see the result both visually and numerically. You can also calculate the height of an object if you know the length of its shadow.


With an affordable one-time purchase of Lumos Pro, you can also:

• Search for a location by name or manually enter coordinates

• Save locations for later reference or offline use*

• Take notes on a saved location and have them readily available the next time you view it


*The map view and Street View do not currently support offline use

NOTE: The sun and moon positions calculated by Lumos are accurate to within a small fraction of a degree. However, as with any augmented-reality app, the accuracy of the projection is dependent on the underlying hardware. If you are seeing inaccurate positions, please calibrate your device's compass and ensure that you are not near any sources of electromagnetic interference (e.g. microwaves, computers, car engines, high voltage lines). Phone cases containing batteries are known to cause compass interference. You can also use the visual calibration tool to align the projection with sun’s current position. Please feel free to contact us if you continue to have issues.

As a founder and CEO, your role is to start up your coffee shop, manage coffee bean blends, create the best coffee products, hire and motivate the best talents, conduct effective marketing, manage financials, expand the business to multiple cities and build the biggest coffee empire!

=== What’s New in 2 ===

- Open hundreds of coffee shops across multiple cities, but you now deal with the real cities: San Francisco, Chicago, New York, Tokyo, London, Paris and Berlin.

- You can also choose a game currency from USD, EURO, JPY and GBP.

- Choose store interiors, exteriors and coffee equipment to uniquely position your shops. You can now even design custom interiors.

- Set product menus and pricing wisely to compete with neighboring coffee shops. You can now also develop brand-new products.

- Conduct store marketing to drive traffic while minimizing the cost. You now have more marketing campaigns.

- Hire store staff and keep them working hard and happy. Their services will determine your store's popularity. You can now even hire a store manager to delegate many of daily store operations.

- Store staff and customers cause many accidents every week. You deal with it one by one or delegate them to store managers.

- Borrow money from banks if you need cash. Watch out the interest rates, though, now that every country has its own GDP growth and bank policy rate.

- As the number of stores grows, store management gets complex. Open offices, hire white-collar workers and create functional departments: Human Resource, Finance, Products, Marketing, Engineering, Executive, and Investment.

- Through the HR division, provides training, recreations, compensations and benefits to employees.

- The Finance now has a cash flow statement, in addition to income statement and balance sheet. Grasp financial details like a pro through realistic statements.

- Conduct city wide marketing campaigns to raise brand awareness.

- The engineering division allows you to develop new online services and applications. They will penetrate globally.

- Hire C-Level executives such as COO, CFO, CTO, CMO… and delegate high levels of responsibility to them. Make sure to incentivize them with stock options and RSUs.

- As a chairman of the board, you can hold a board meeting and discuss your compensation and company’s dividends.

- Work with investment banks and achieve IPO and M&A.

- Through the Investment division, expand your empire into non-coffee businesses such as real estate and stock investment.

- Your personal wealth is now separated from your company’s.

- You can now store your games in iCloud so that you can sync them across your multiple devices.

- As always, no annoying ads.","Games,Business,Role Playing,Simulation",Coffee Inc 2,$1.99

Most people are scared of it, but I want to sneak inside.

There are so many rumors, I don’t know what to believe

Some kids say the top floor glows at night and that crazy aliens live up there. Some say that strange experiments are going on in the living room. One kid I know absolutely swears they heard weird music coming from the basement. Can a house sing? I’ve also talked to kids who say the entire kitchen is covered in slime. Even my best friend, who never believes anything, told me the house is alive!

I had to see for myself

I did, I swear. I peeked inside last week. First, I made sure no one was around. Then I got on my tiptoes and spied in the kitchen window. I saw just the edge of the fridge. I think I saw some kind of gooshy red stuff oozing out of it, but I’m not really sure. Then I heard creepy rumbling sounds coming from the basement. It totally freaked me out and yup, I admit it, I sprinted all the way home. 

But I’m just so curious, I can’t help myself. I think I’ll be going back. I want to go inside. I could really use a partner, though. Seriously, will you come with me?

Collect supplies and rescue your family before the nuke hits. Stay alive in your fallout shelter. Make difficult decisions, ration food and hunt mutant cockroaches. And maybe survive. Or not.

60 Seconds! requires at least an iPhone 5, iPad 3, or iPad mini 2.

As Ted, a responsible citizen and a family man, you are faced with a slight disturbance to your happy, suburban lifestyle. THE NUCLEAR APOCALYPSE.

With only 60 seconds left to impact, guide Ted in a mad, intense and action packed dash through his house in search of his family and useful supplies. Everything will be against you - time, your very own furniture, the house that's different every time you play and the fundamental question - what to take with you and who to leave behind?

Reaching the fallout shelter in time and alive is only the beginning. Whatever you scavenged and whoever you saved will play a vital role in your survival. Each survival story will be different, with every day surprising you with unexpected events. Will all of these stories end well? It's up to you. Ration food and water, make best use of your supplies, face difficult choices and even venture into the wasteland.

Good luck.

EXPERIENCE
the suburbian nightmare of a nuke dropping down on your neighbourhood in this atomic, dark comedy set in 1950s.

SCAVENGE
any supplies, you will need to survive, and family members in a 60 second rush through your randomly generated house.

PREPARE
for the worst. Don’t just grab arbitrary items, plan your survival and follow helpful tips from emergency broadcasts!

SURVIVE
in a fallout shelter with whatever you brought with you. How many days will you last? Will everyone make it out alive?

DECIDE
what to do, when the post-apocalyptic world pushes you to the corner. Will you risk going outside? Who is not eating dinner, when barely any food is left? How do you deal with a mutant cockroach infestation?","Games,Simulation,Adventure",60 Seconds! Atomic Adventure,$3.99

As an airport CEO, your mission is to build and arrange interior and exterior areas, sign and manage partnerships with airlines, and control passenger flows and satisfaction.




- The airport is a city in itself. You will need to build, arrange and modernize your airport infrastructure to receive your aircraft.


- Devise your strategy and sign dozens of partnerships with airline companies, manage contracts and build your relationships.

- Your passengers are arriving from the city! Manage passenger flows from their arrival, offering them comfortable infrastructure and various stores to do their shopping. You will increase their spending and your profits. Will you be able to keep them satisfied? 

- Control everything, from passenger inflows to air traffic control, check-in desks, security checkpoints, boarding gates, flight scheduling and aircraft boarding.


BRING YOUR AIRPORT TO LIFE AND PERSONALIZE IT TO YOUR TASTE.

- Strategically arrange your airport infrastructure; build your terminals, including the apron, taxiway, runways, fuel stations, catering production sites, check-in desks, security checkpoints, boarding gates, passport control points, coffee shops, stores and more. You can also choose from a wide range of items to decorate your airport!

- Organize your airport to meet your passengers’ needs and improve your services to speed up processes, improve profitability and provide a greater level of comfort, which will have a knock-on effect on your relationships with partner airlines. The airport is like a whole city that needs to be managed!

 
DEVISE A STRATEGY AND MANAGE PARTNERSHIPS

- Decide on your airport strategy, striking a balance between low-cost and premium flights. Decide on flight types: regular and charter flights, short and medium-haul aircraft, and the possibility of opening general aviation routes.

- Sign partnerships to define the number of flights in your airport. Each time you sign for extra flights in addition to an existing contract, you strengthen your relationship with the partner airline.

- Build relationships: each flight will bring a signature bonus! Be careful, however, because if you sign too many flights and are unable to maintain them, you run the risk of damaging the relationship with your partner and losing the contract.

- Choose from among our 3D aircraft models to fulfil your contractual obligations.

- Define your schedule on a 24-hour basis, planning fights up to 2 weeks in advance.

FLEET AND PASSENGER MANAGEMENT

- Your passengers’ satisfaction level will affect your partnerships. Make sure your services, runways, flight scheduling, fleet and personnel are optimal to win points with airlines.
- Consider factors such as the number of check-ins and lateness. How many passengers managed to board the aircraft?
- Are you keeping to your schedule for take-offs and landings? Is the condition of your runway causing lateness? Are your passengers boarding and disembarking on time? 
- Have you efficiently scheduled your airport services (including refueling, catering and luggage handling)? These services can affect lateness in the schedule. Was your aircraft refueled on time? Did your catering service have enough trucks to make deliveries to each aircraft? Are your partner airlines satisfied with the services you have provided?

-- ABOUT THE GAME --

After searching high and low for your lost pet, you get a surprise call that your pet was found at Papa's Pancakeria in Maple Mountain.  Papa Louie has a busy schedule, but since your pet likes the restaurant so much, he's left the Pancakeria for you to run while he's gone!  You'll be knee-deep in batter as you prepare fluffy pancakes, golden waffles, and warm stacks of french toast for your customers through all the seasons of the year!

Each station in the restaurant is a hands-on process, and you'll have to multi-task between all of the different stations to keep up with your orders.

While controlling your own robot, you compete against your katana wielding, Ai driven robot, in head-to-head or balloon-popping action! Eighteen sword forms, nine movement options on a 3x7 mat provide almost unlimited possibilities. Choose well!


Experience Counts:
Your Spar Partner gets better with experience.  It literally ""remembers"" at what location hits were made using a particular sword form. You will get better yourself by remembering what each of the 18 sword forms does. If your Spar Partner seems to be falling behind, go to ""Practice"" mode or ""Balloon Clear"" mode to help your Spar Partner gain experience faster. If you are falling behind, well that is up to you!


Spar Partner Katan is lots of fun, but easy to learn. Pick it up and play for a few moments when you are in the mood, that is what ""idle"" games are for!


More details:
Each sword form is a unique animation. Points are scored when a katana or a foot collides with a hit box. Hit boxes are located at head, shoulder and torso.  Balloons have their own hit box located at the same elevation as the robot hit boxes.  The katana follows the animation and must contact a hit box to score a point. Katana movement is precise, so direction and range count. There is no magical my-stats-are-better so I win. Your robot has to actually hit the target to score.

Because each katana ""form"" is unique, it tends to beat some forms but loses to others. Think rock-paper-scissors on steroids. Learn what works, and doesn't work, by controlling both robots in ""Practice"" mode. Learn where hit boxes are located and where a form does damage by doing a ""Balloon Clear"". In these two learning modes you control both robots.


When you know what your are doing, or before, complete a ""Balloon Race"" against your Spar Partner. When you really know what your are doing, or before, complete a Match against your Spar Partner. Scores are kept automatically.  Practice mode and Balloon Clear can go for unlimited  rounds. Match and Balloon Race each last for nine rounds and a winner is declared.


In addition, you set the color and name of both your Spar Partner and the robot you operate. Colors can be tailored to your taste from a table.  You can even make unique colors by entering a hex code.

TeacherTool was developed in practical use for practical applications and has been setting unrivaled standards in terms of data security, functional scope, ease-of-use and support since 2009. TeacherTool will revolutionize the way your student administration by making it more effective, easier to navigate and more customized. TeacherTool puts all of your key student information right at your fingertips so that it can be instantly accessed and edited. By assigning your own password and using powerful data encryption tools, you will also be able to protect the data against unauthorized access.

If, for instance, a student inquires about his or her grade status, you will be able to spontaneously review with the student, criterion by criterion, his or her performance development based on compelling graphics.  

If a proposed grade is not in compliance with your pedagogic standards, you can make individual adjustments to the grade computation process at your discretion!

Do you prefer to use symbols to grade your students’ work? - TeacherTool also has the capability to use symbolic grading systems (including Emojis for your youngest pupils!) The solution can readily convert conventional grades into symbols and vice versa – no adjustments required. 

If a student provides an excuse for an absence, you will be able to see when the student was absent in TeacherTool right away. Simply click on the identified time frame to excuse the absence. 

If you have to grade a test, all you have to do is define the number of points for each individual question and TeacherTool will automatically convert them for you. You can even use this tool for other types of assessments, e.g. in physical education. 

If you want to create a tally sheet for homework, you will find it convenient that  TeacherTool treats all types of remarks/comments as tally sheets and that homework is just one of many possible applications.  

You may also want to record data during lessons in the classroom. Handling this task is one of the special capabilities of the TeacherTool! It knows your class schedule and is very versatile when it comes to making updates: it proposes times of absence to be logged, automatically calculates late arrivals, generates entries into the register and handles lots of other tasks. 

Do you have to plan and document lessons? Simply use the register to assist you with planning. Attach your digital teaching materials to each classroom hour scheduled or download them from the Cloud anytime you need them! Photograph your blackboard presentations and project the photos to the screen at the beginning of the next lesson to recap and review. 

Need some help remembering? – Of course there’s a tool for that. Simply take pictures of your students (after obtaining their consent), create an interactive seating chart and set up the TeacherTool to remind you of all organizational matters!

TeacherTool is a universal app, i.e. you can install it on all of your iOS devices and use it simultaneously. Via encrypted data transfer, it is possible to synchronize the data between the different devices exclusively via your WLAN connection. Hence, no data is loaded onto external servers and you do not have to register yourself or your students anywhere to be able to use TeacherTool. TeacherTool is far superior to similar competitive products since it offers maximum data security and privacy. TeacherTool is also your best choice because of its expeditious and competent support services, which are at your disposal whenever you have any questions.

What Teachers Say
""This year, I implemented ABCmouse in every lesson, not only during my lesson time but also during the activities and center time. My students started picking up their letters faster, they were applying phonics faster, they were recognizing sight words faster. When testing came around, I had 78% of my class test advanced in foundational skills. That's never happened before. ABCmouse captivates a child's attention in such a wonderful, marvelous way. It's not just them memorizing stuff, they have the skill, and they're making those connections across the content areas.""—Kindergarten Teacher

""On ABCmouse my children are learning to read, they're doing math problems, social studies, science, everything. . . . Since we've begun ABCmouse, our scores are just amazing!""

An accidental object, even though it may look tiny and harmless, can completely ruin the entire composition of a photo and make it worthless. However, it’s not a pain if you have your favorite TouchRetouch at hand.

Here at ADVA Soft, we never stop creating. We are constantly developing new technologies and features to improve TouchRetouch both functionally and visually. The most recent additions, such as the mesh removal feature, new algorithm for edge-aware object removal, and a few more great new things, reflect the needs expressed by you and reveal our appreciation of your loyalty.

Below you'll find more details on what features TouchRetouch has to offer.

ADVANTAGES:

• No subscriptions, ads, and in-app purchases
• No personal information requests
• No quality and EXIF data loss
• Professional photo edits with ease

NOTE

The automatic object removal algorithm works best on uniform backgrounds.

What magic can you do with TouchRetouch?

• Remove wires, power lines, and other linear objects
• Eliminate objects like street signs, trash cans, stop lights
• Get rid of meshes in the foreground
• Remove background people
• Erase pimples, skin blemishes, and wrinkles in the most natural way
• Clean up travel photos
• Remove text from Instagram and Snapchat posts
• Restore old photos

How will you create magic in your photos?

SINGLE-TOUCH RETOUCH

The app works great for quick retouches.
Make minor imperfections disappear just by marking them. It takes seconds for the app to remove small details that ruin your photos.

If the task is to erase a line from your pic, mark only a section of the line or just tap it to remove it completely; no need to be precise — the app will find the line! In the manual retouch mode, all lines have control points, thus giving you more control and flexibility over adjusting curved segments.

OBJECT REMOVAL LIKE MAGIC

The app declutters your images in a matter of seconds. That could either be people or other background details you may need to erase. Use automatic content removal with the Brush tool or, when the result is not that perfect, manual retouching with the Clone Stamp tool to repair a photo. 

AUTOMATIC MESH DETECTION AND REMOVAL

If you think that ""getting past the mesh netting"" is quite a challenging task, you probably haven’t tried using TouchRetouch yet. The app offers a way to deal with the problem in two simple steps. Select the tool from the main menu and tap the Go button to have the mesh removed just like magic. The whole detection and selection work between these two steps is done by the algorithm; no action is required on your part.

HELPFUL TUTORIALS

Check out the in-app tutorials and play around a bit with the app to learn how to get the most out of it.
Little effort and experience are needed to become a pro in using TouchRetouch. The interface and layout are clear and intuitive enough to make you feel comfortable the very first time you use it.

Download TouchRetouch now to harness photo magic from your pocket.

Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.

AnkiMobile was written by the lead developer of Anki and AnkiWeb, and it has been around since 2010. Beware other apps using ""Anki"" in their name that have sprung up recently - they are not compatible with the rest of the Anki ecosystem, and they offer far fewer features.

Some of AnkiMobile's features include:

- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.
- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.
- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.
- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.
- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.
- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.
- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.
- Support for displaying mathematical equations with MathJax, and rendering LaTeX created with the computer version.
- Support for adding images drawn with the Apple Pencil to your cards.

Please note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display and schedule your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. Add-ons are not supported, so while you can study image occlusion cards created with the computer version, they can not be created within AnkiMobile. For this reason, please start with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.

The cloud synchronization service is optional, and data can also be imported/exported from the app via a USB cable or AirDrop.

Like all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see Apple's Volume Purchase Program.

For more information on AnkiMobile, including a link to the online manual, please have a look at the support page: https://docs.ankimobile.net/support.html. If you have any questions or want to report an issue, please let us know on our support site and we'll get back to you as soon as possible.","Education,Productivity",AnkiMobile Flashcards,$24.99

Different states of mind are associated with specific brainwave frequencies that would be inaudible if played directly. These frequencies can be induced in the brain by playing two different tones into each ear (binaural tones), which after being processed by the brain, are perceived as an inaudible beat matching the target brainwave frequency. As you listen, your own brainwaves fall into step and synchronize with this frequency.

Bagging a red squirrel without the right gear can be challenging. It's important to have a gun right for the job. Good hunters take everything they need to bag red squirrels with them into the woods.

One of the most important tools for a successful hunt is a good red squirrel call. 

No longer do you need drag along bulky electronic red squirrel calls or the even more cumbersome mouth calls. With this red squirrel sounds and gray squirrel calls app you can simply select from a large selection of different red squirrel sounds to attract the red squirrels to your hunting location. 

The sounds included are red squirrel calls, red squirrel call, varmint calls, red squirrel calls for hunters, red squirrel calls for hunting,  red squirrel calls +, predator, big game hunting calls, deer calls and red squirrel calls just to name a few. 

You can play the sounds individually and set them to repeat after the amount of seconds that you desire. Or you can manually tap different sounds create a deadly combination of calls that will work perfectly for the red squirrels you are hunting.

RETOUCHING AND COMPOSITING:
Enhance images and adjust color tones with Curves. Remove unwanted elements with the Spot Healing Brush, Healing Brush, and Clone Stamp tools. Bring in your raw photos from your camera, iPhone 13 Pro (ProRaw), or Adobe Photoshop Lightroom, edit them with the power of Photoshop, and send them back to your Lightroom catalog. Use the Object Selection and Select Subject tools to make quick and detailed selections when you’re combining images and fine-tune them with the Refine Edge Brush. Convert layers into Smart Objects that you can transform in a nondestructive way.

PAINTERLY EFFECTS:
Blur the lines and soften distinct edges with the Smudge tool, which simulates the effects of painting with a wet paintbrush. Smudge, mix, and blend to create an original masterpiece. The Sponge tool gives you full control to adjust the color saturation precisely where it’s needed. Intensify or remove color from selected areas in a single brushstroke.

And now, we’ve been named one of Apple’s 2021 Apps of the Year for connection.
Creating new connections has never been easier. Bumble is working to lift the stigma of online dating by employing unprecedented standards for respectful behavior. Because of this relentless dedication, millions of people are using Bumble to build valuable relationships every single day.

DATING, FRIENDS & NETWORKING

Bumble is at the forefront of matchmaking technology by providing an app that allows users to foster more than just romantic connections. The industry-leading app empowers users to swipe through potential connections across three different modes:

- Bumble Date: On Bumble Date, women make the first move. We’ve changed the archaic rules of the dating game so that you can form meaningful relationships in a respectful way.

- Bumble BFF: Life is better with friends. Whether you’re new to a city or looking to expand your circle, Bumble BFF is the easiest way to make new friends.

- Bumble Bizz: Now we’re in business. Use Bumble Bizz to network, find mentors, and create new career opportunities.


Bumble is the first app of its kind to bring dating, friend-finding, and career-building into a single social networking platform.

CHANGING THE RULES OF THE GAME

At Bumble, women make the first move. In heterosexual matches, the woman has 24 hours to make the first move and the man has 24 hours to respond. In same-sex matches, either person has 24 hours to make the first move, while the other individual has 24 hours to respond, or else, the connection expires. By prompting our users to be bold and make the first move we’ve seen over 3 billion messages sent to date.

THE BUZZ IS REAL

“Bumble exists to empower women...” (Fast Company)
“Bumble is just an app: but it’s changing the discussion.” (Wired)
“Bumble offers an alternative that prioritises meaningful connections, with women calling the shots:” (UK Sunday Times)
“Bumble rejects hate speech to make users feel safe on its dating app” (Texas Standard)
“What makes Bumble different from other dating apps...is its focus on giving women all the power. ” (Business Insider)
